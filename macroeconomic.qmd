## [**U.S. Inflation**]{style="color: #9D0F6A ;"}

**Last update**: September, 2025

The United States employs several different methods to monitor inflation, and it is crucial to comprehend the distinctions among these measures to gain a clear understanding of economic trends.

**PCE Inflation**

PCE inflation measures the prices of goods and services consumed by households and nonprofit institutions, including food, energy, housing , and more. It is more comprehensive than the Consumer Price Index (CPI). PCE inflation accounts for both direct household spending (you pay) and spending on behalf of households (someone pays for you). For example, when your employer provides health insurance or the government provides Medicare.

-   Compared to the same month last year, the PCE price index rose by 2.7% in August 2025 (T7). The Federal Reserve targets a long-term PCE inflation rate of 2%. From the preceding month, the PCE price index increased 0.3% (T5).

-   Personal income rose by 0.4% in August on a monthly basis, according to the estimates published on September 26, 2025 (T3).


**Core PCE Inflation**

Core PCE index is considered a more stable measure of inflation, exclude food and energy prices due to their volatility, focuses on underlying inflation trends, and provides a better understanding of inflationary pressures.

-   When compared to the same month in the previous year, the core PCE price index rose by 2.9% in July 2025, which is slightly higher than the 2.8% increase recorded in June, 2025:T7.

**CPI (Consumer Price Index)**

**Last update:** October, 2025. 

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the average change in prices for a basket of goods and services. It is often used to adjust the cost of living, negotiate wages, and determine Social Security benefits. CPI only accounts for out-of-pocket expentures(expenses you pay directly)

-   The annual inflation rate for the United States increased by 3% for the 12 months ending September 2025, compared to the previous rate of 2.9% in August, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data.


-   The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.3% in September 2025 compared to the previous month.

| Item        | MoM | YoY  |
|-------------|-----|------|
| CPI overall | 0.3 | 3.0  |
| Food        | 0.2 | 3.1  |
| Energy      | 1.5 | 2.8  |
| Services    | 0.2 | 3.5  |
| Shelter     | 0.2 | 3.6  |

-   The CPI for September 2025 is scheduled to be released on November, 2025, at 08:30 a.m. (ET).

**Last update:** October, 2025. 

-   According to Federal Roserve Economic data, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increase by 3.02% in September 2025 compared to the same month a year earlier.

## [**U.S. Interest rates**]{style="color: #9D0F6A ;"}

**Last update:** October, 2025.

-   The U.S. central bank rate was lowered to 4% following the most recent adjustment in October 2025.

> Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. At today's meeting, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 3-3/4 to 4 percent.
>
> Data available prior to the shutdown show that growth in economic activity may be on a somewhat firmer trajectory that expected, primarily reflecting stronger consumer spending. Business investment in equipment and intangibles has continued to expand, while activity in the housing sector remains weak. The shutdown of the federal government will weigh on economic activity while it persists, but these effects should reverse after the shutdown ends.
>
> — Jerome Powell, October 29, 2025.

**Last update:** January, 2025.

-   There was a signal in the Jackson Hole's speech, which marked the end of the four-year cycle of increase in the interest rates by the FED.

-   The new cycle attempts to normalize economy, including indicators like the U.S. interest rate curve, according to the averages of the last hundred years.

-   The decision demonstrates FED's concern for the lower end of the labor market, while de high end is still very tight.

> Normality is a positively sloped yield curve and we think the terminal rate in FED funds is 3%. Where should 10 years be if we're at 3%? We should at least be 100 to 150 basis point positively sloped.
>
> — Gary Cohn, VP of IBM

-   Some indicators that may be evaluated during 2025 are:

    -   Oil.

    -   Commodities.

    -   Shelter (new tenant rents vs old tenant rents).

**Last update:** January, 2025.

Chair Powell on a question from Elizabeth Schulze of ABC News(December meeting, 2024). Why do you think it is that inflation is proving to be more stubborn than you'd expected?

> I think people are feeling right now is the effect of high prices, not high inflation. So we understand very well that prices went up by a great deal and people really feel that. And it's prices of food and transportation, and heating your home, and things like that, so there's tremendous pain in that burst of inflation that was very global. This was everywhere in all the advanced economies at the same time. So now we have inflation itself is way down but people are still feeling high prices and that is really what people are feeling. The best we can do for them, and that's who we work for, is to get inflation back down to its target and keep it there so that people are earning big, real wage increase so that their wages are going up, their compensation is going up faster than inflation year upon year upon year, and that's what will restore people's good feeling about the economy.
>
> That's what it will take, and that's what we're aiming for.

> — Jerome Powell, December meeting 2024

## [**U.S. Labor Market**]{style="color: #9D0F6A ;"}

**Last update:** September, 2025.

-   The unemployment rate stood at 4.3% in August 2025. A Job gains in healthcare were partially offset by losses in the federal government and in mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction.

-   In August 2025, the unemployment rate was 4.3%, representing 7.4 million people. Of those, 1.9 million were long-term unemployed(*out of work for 27 weeks or more*) accounting for 25.7% of all unemployed persons(TA12).

-   The labor force participation rate declined to 62.3% in August 2025 (TA-1), down 0.4 percentage points from the previous year.

-   One important indicator of the labor market is continuing claims, which track the number of individuals filing for ongoing unemployment benefits each week. This indicator is crucial because it reflects the health of the labor market, signal consumer spending strength, helps identify recession risks, informs Reserve policy decisions, and guides business confidence(all in one metric).

-   Another important labor market indicator is aggregate hours worked. The chart below shows the average weekly hours of all employees in the total private sector. One of the first signs of a slowing economy is a reduction in job openings(that's the first wave). The second wave is a decline in hours worked, which is a critical metric. When employers begin cutting hours, the next step is often cutting positions.

Labor market tightness refers to the number of job vacancies per unemployed worker, and it plays a key role in monetary policy decisions. A very tight labor market may indicate an overheating economy, causing firms to compete for workers and raise wages. If wages grow faster than productivity, inflation can rise. To address this, central banks like the Federal Reserve may increase interest rates to slow down economic activity and reduce labor demand, easing inflation.

A tight labor market can also promote inclusion by helping groups historically facing employment barriers, as firms become more willing to hire and train them. The Federal Reseve's average inflation targeting allows lower interest rates during low inflation, supporting a tight labor market and more inclusive job growth.


The chart below, shared by Mick Dueholm and Serdar Ozkan on the FRED Blog, illustrates labor market tightness as the ratio of job openings to unemployed individuals. This measure indicates how many job opportunities are available for each person seeking work.

## [**U.S. 10-Year Treasury bonds**]{style="color: #9D0F6A ;"}

**Last update:** September, 2025.

-   The 10-year Treasury yield is a key indicator of investor sentiment about the economy. It represents the interest rate the U.S. government pays to borrow money for a decade and serves as benchmark for other interest rates. This yield influences borrowing costs, affects the valuation of financial assets, and reflects expectations about inflation and economic growth.

-   The chart below shows the United States 10-Year Government Bond yield.

- The spread between Moody's Baa corporate bond yield and the 10-year Treasury yield is a key measure of credit risk and economic sentiment. It reflects how much extra return investors demand for holding riskier corporate debt over safe government bonds. A widening spread signals rising concern about corporate defaults or economic slowdown, while a narrowing spread suggest confidence in the economy and corporate health. This indicator often move with the business cycle and can act as a leading signal of recession or recovery. Investors and policymakers use it to assess market stress, risk appetite, and monetary policy impact.

- Historically, a spread above ~2.5% has often preceded recessions, while a spread below ~1.5 suggest economic strength.

- Fixed-income investors use the spread to gauge relative value between corporate and government bonds. a high spread may signal undervalued corporate bonds(if default risk is overestimated), and a low spread may indicate overvaluation or excessive risk-taking.

## [**U.S. Sectors 2Q24**]{style="color: #9D0F6A ;"}

### [**Overall**]{style="color: #9D0F6A ;"}

**Last update:** January, 2025

Revenue-related cash flow remains a challenge, impacting supply chains, the labor market, and debt costs specially since some of theses are tied to revwnue performance. In such cycles, highly leveraged companies often file for bankruptcy, which is important to monitor due to increased volatility. The perception of high interest rates and monetary tightening makes it difficult to pass costs on to consumers, prompting businesses to adjust their operations in pursuit of greater efficiency. Other observed behaviors include:

-   There has been a temporary rise in unemployment rates, though without any sudden shifts. Job losses are beginning to occur primarily among workers with lower levels of skills, education, and income-generating capacity. These indicators are being closely monitored by Federal Reserve officials, and signs of concern can be seen in Chairman Powell's recent statements.

-   Companies are making decisions to reduce costs of goods sold(COGS) and operating expenses(SG&A).

-   Temporary increase in the cost of capital for private debt.

-   Reorganization of supply chains.

### [**Agroindustry**]{style="color: #9D0F6A ;"}

**Last update:** January, 2025

-   2023 was an incredible year for agriculture, with high productivity for wheat and corn. In 2024, the harvest is a little late(e.g South Dakota area). There was high intensity of rainfall at the beginning of planting with mild temperatutes, causing the crop not to develop as much as in 2023. During the wheat harvest, usually in August, the corn needs more rain to fill the grain, but this year there was not so much during this period.

-   The distortions generated during the pandemic is make 2024 a year of adjusments that are being faced by growers, agricultural auto manufacturing, and machinery and equipment sales, temporarily affeting jobs.

-   Looking for agricultural prices, they are still not good. The expectation is not for a bad year, but it will not be as good as 2023. Sales of new equipment have fallen, making it necessary to adjust costs and expenses in companies such as John Deer and CNH industrial.

### [**Automotive**]{style="color: #9D0F6A ;"}

**Last update:** January, 2025

-   The automotive industry faces many challenges in 2024. Slowing growth, increased competition, supply chain disruptions generated during the pandemic and business decisions caused distortions in costs and prices that grew way above the population's income and general inflation rates. This process may take a few years to stabilize.

-   The volume of new car sales does not follow the same trend as population growth. It requires a deeper analysis to identify cause-and-effect relationships, but for now, the hypotheses raised are accessibility and the durability of the vehicles acording to @autolinenetwork2024.

    -   From a price perspective, historically, it takes 25 weeks of average household income to buy a new vehicle. The average household income in 2024 is \$75.000 (\$1.400 per week) which would be enough to buy a vehicle worth \$36.000 dollars.

    -   The age of the vehicles on the road in the United States is 12.6 years acording to @parekh2024

    -   The average cost of car ownership in 2024 was around \$12,000 annually according to BLS (vehicle purchase 46%, fuels 22%, finance charges 3%, repairs 8%, insurance 15%, others 6%)

### [**Transportation**]{style="color: #9D0F6A ;"}

**Last update:** September, 2025.

Between 2020 and 2023, there was overcapacity in the carrier population due to fluctuating demand, wich remais inconsistent and is currently undergoing adjustments. Despite this, capacity level are still high relative to shipment volumes, putting pressure on logistics providers to streamline operations and pursue efficiency gains. Some carriers are downsizing and reducing freet sies to adapt. On the other hand, the total number of carriers declined by 33,200 between December 2022 and October 2024.

### [**Housing market**]{style="color: #9D0F6A ;"}

**Last update:** September, 2025

-   The U.S. median home price in 4Q24 is \$419.200 compared to \$423.200 last year, a decrease of 0.95% and -5.3% compared to the price peak in 4Q22.

-   Spring is busiest time for the housing market in U.S. starting in April and peaks in June when the average number of existing homes sold per day increases significantly, and historically, home prices tend to rise during this period. On the other hand, in 2021 and 2022 home prices rose 16.7% and 13%, respectively, way above the personal income and this factor may change the effect of this year season. With builders facing challenges in passing on costs to consumers, improving proceses can be a relevant factor in avoiding or minimizing the effects on margins.

-   The plot below shows the behaviors from the perspective of supply and demand.

-   In 2025 home buyers are looking for better prices and interest rates, two family homes with smarter technologies and other factors that may be relevant such as a gyms, ceilling fans, energy star rated windows, patio, hardwood floors in the living areas, and side-by-side kitchen sink, and close to fun and public transportation.

-   One modality that has been gaining traction is built-to-rent commnunities driving for some factors:

    -   **Affordability constraints:** Rising home prices and higher mortgage rates have priced many out of homeownership.
    -   **Desire for flexibility and amenities:** Renters increasingly seek convenient, maintenance-coworking facilities.
    -   **Demographics:** Millenials, GenZ, and retirees are opting for rental lifestyles.
    -   **Changing household dynamics:** The growing number of single-person households. The share of people living alone increased every decade from 1940 to 2020 according to @bureau2023. In 2020 the proportion was 27.6% compared to 26.7% in 2010.

-   Some indicators that may be evaluated during the next three months are:

    -   Mortgage rates, increasing inventories, listing price, time homes are on market.
    -   Net new home orders that represent the number of new sales contracts that have been finalized and signed by buyers minus customer home order cancellations booked.
    -   Companies financial guidance such as Lennar, Toll Brothers, D.R. Horton, Pultegroup and KB Home.
