## [**Interest rates**]{style="color: #9D0F6A ;"}

-   United States Central Bank Rate stands at 4.75%, following the most recent adjustment in November 2024.

> Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. We see the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals as being roughly in balance, and we're attentive to the risks to both sides of our mandate.
>
> At today's meeting, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point, to 4 1/2 percent to 4 3/4 percent. This further recalibration of our policy stance will help maintain the strenght of the economy and the labor markeet and will continue to enable further progress on inflation as we move toward a more neutral stance over time.
>
> We know that reducing policy strain restraint too quickly could hinder progress on inflation. At the same time, reducing policy restraint too slowly could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.
>
> — Jerome Powell

-   There was a signal in the Jackson Hole's speech, which marked the end of the four-year cycle of increase in the interest rates by the FED.

-   The new cycle attempts to normalize economy, including indicators like the U.S. interest rate curve, according to the averages of the last hundred years.

-   The decision demonstrates FED's concern for the lower end of the labor market, while de high end is still very tight.

> Normality is a positively sloped yield curve and we think the terminal rate in FED funds is 3%. Where should 10 years be if we're at 3%? We should at least be 100 to 150 basis point positively sloped.
>
> — Gary Cohn, VP of IBM

-   Some indicators that may be evaluated during the next three months are:

    -   Oil.

    -   Commodities.

    -   Shelter 2025 (new tenant rents vs old tenant rents).

## [**Labor Market**]{style="color: #9D0F6A ;"}

-   One important indicator of labor market is the continuing claims that track the number of residents filing for ongoing unemployment benefits in a given week. The number of continuing claims for the week ending September 21, 2024 is 1.826 million. Less than the four-week moving average of 1.829 million. Meanwhile the number of initial claims for the week ending sep. 21, 2024 was 225.000 very close the four-week moving average of 224,250.

-   Another importat labor market indicator is aggregate hours worked. The chart below shows the average weekly hours of all employees, total private. The first thing you see when the economy is slowing down is a reduction in job openings. That is the first wave. The secong wave that you see is the number of hours worked. And that is a very important metric because when you're cutting hours, the next step is to actually cut positions.

## [**Sectors 2Q24**]{style="color: #9D0F6A ;"}

### [**Overall**]{style="color: #9D0F6A ;"}

Revenue's cash flow is a challenge which has a short-term effect on supply chains, labor market, and debt costs as some of them are backed by revenue. Generally, in these cycles, highly leveraged companies tend to file for bankruptcy which are important to observe, mainly due to volatility. The perception of high interest rates and monetary tightening make it difficult to pass on prices to the consumer, leading business to adjust their processes striving for efficiency. Other behaviors:

-   Temporary rise in unemployment rates, however withour sudden moviments. The job losses begin at the lowest rungs in terms of skills, educational attainment, income making capacity. This indicators are being closely monitored by FED officials and the signals can be seen in Mr. Powell's statements.

-   Decisions by companies towards reducing costs(COGS) and operating expenses(SG&A).

-   Temporary increase in the cost of capital for privet debt.

-   Supply chain reorganization.

-   Increase of risk of plain vanilla recession.

### [**Agroindustry**]{style="color: #9D0F6A ;"}

-   2023 was an incredible year for agriculture, with high productivity for wheat and corn. In 2024, the harvest is a little late(e.g South Dakota area). There was high intensity of rainfall at the beginning of planting with mild temperatutes, causing the crop not to develop as much as in 2023. During the wheat harvest, usually in August, the corn needs more rain to fill the grain, but this year there was not so much during this period.

-   The distortions generated during the pandemic is make 2024 a year of adjusments that are being faced by growers, agricultural auto manufacturing, and machinery and equipment sales, temporarily affeting jobs.

-   Looking for agricultural prices, they are still not good. The expectation is not for a bad year, but it will not be as good as 2023. Sales of new equipment have fallen, making it necessary to adjust costs and expenses in companies such as John Deer and CNH industrial.

### [**Automotive**]{style="color: #9D0F6A ;"}

-   The automotive industry faces many challenges in 2024. Slowing growth, increased competition, supply chain disruptions generated during the pandemic and business decisions caused distortions in costs and prices that grew way above the population's income and general inflation rates. This process may take a few years to stabilize.

-   The volume of new car sales does not follow the same trend as population growth. It requires a deeper analysis to identify cause-and-effect relationships, but for now, the hypotheses raised are accessibility and the durability of the vehicles acording to @autolinenetwork2024.

    -   From a price perspective, historically, it takes 25 weeks of average household income to buy a new vehicle. The average household income in 2024 is \$75.000 (\$1.400 per week) which would be enough to buy a vehicle worth \$36.000 dollars.

    -   The age of the vehicles on the road in the United States is 12.6 years acording to @parekh2024

-   Reducing costs and prices, increasing household income, and finding more sources of revenue such as subscription services are some options that can be observed in the market.

### [**Transportation**]{style="color: #9D0F6A ;"}

There was overcapacity in carrier population during the period from 2020 to 2023 due to demand that has been inconsistent over time and is currently undergoing adjustments. However, capacity still presents high values in relation to volumes pressuring agents to adjust their operations in striving for efficiency gains. Some of those carriers are contracting and reducing their fleets sizes in order to move forward. On the other side the carriers population are reduced in 32.500 from december of 2022 to june of 2024.

-   Tender rejections are currently in 4.5%, and diesel prices are \$3.81 per gallon on average.

-   Flat bed in spot market currently \$2.34 per mile -1% YoY and -7% over five years(2019).

### [**Technology**]{style="color: #9D0F6A ;"}

-   In 2024 investments in disruptive technologies continue to show accelerated growth. The highlight has been in generative AI, which is unlocking possibilities for innovation between interconnected processes such as robotics and augmented reality.

-   Factors such as macroeconomic, geopolitical environment, and intense competition influence the adoption of technology as alternatives to improve operational efficiency in business.
