The chart below shows the average weekly hours of all employees, total private from FRED. The first thing you see when the economy is slowing down is a reduction in job openings. That is the first wave. The secong wave that you see is the number of hours worked. And that is a very important metric because when you're cutting hours, the next step is to actually cut positions.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](macroeconomic_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nSource: Federal Reserve and [U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/) and [U.S. Departament of Labor](https://www.dol.gov)\n\n### 10-Year Treasury bonds\n\n-   United States Central Bank Rate stands at 5.50%, following the most recent adjustment in july 2023.\n-   The chart below shows the United States 10-Year Government Bond yield\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](macroeconomic_files/figure-html/bonds_10y-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nSource: [Yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/), [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS10/)\n\n### 10Y3M curve\n\n-   The spread between United States 10-Year and 3-Months is -136.6 basis points(bp)\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](macroeconomic_files/figure-html/yield_curve-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nSource: [FRED - Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/)\n\n### Overview 2Q24\n\n#### Overall\n\nRevenue's cash flow is a challenge which has a short-term effect on supply chains, labor market and debt costs as some of them are backed by revenue. Generally, in these cycles, highly leveraged companies tend to file for bankruptcy which are important to observe, mainly due to volatility. The perception of high interest rates and monetary tightening make it difficult to pass on prices to the consumer, leading business to adjust their process searching for efficiency.\n\n-   Temporary rise in unemployment rates but without abrupt movements. The job losses begin at the lowest rungs in terms of skills, educational attainment, income making capacity. This indicators are being closely monitored by FED officials and the reflection can be seen in Mr. Powell's speeches.\n\n-   Actions to improve the efficiency of costs(COGS) and operating expenses(SG&A) by companies.\n\n-   Temporary increase in the cost of capital for privet debt.\n\n-   Supply chain reorganization.\n\n-   Increase of risk of plain vanilla recession\n\n#### Agroindustry: dairy sector adjustments, machines (e.g. John Deer).\n\n-   here\n\n#### Auto industry: sales, operation results, investments, and projections\n\n-   here\n\n![Auto sales by brand 2Q24](img/auto_results_24.jpg)\n\n#### Transportation: carrier population, tender rejections, volume, capacity.\n\nThere was overcapacity in carrier population during the period from 2020 to 2023 due to demand that has been inconsistent over time and is currently undergoing adjustments.
