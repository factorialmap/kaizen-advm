The number of continuing claims for the week ending Aug 3, 2024 is 1.864 million. That is slightly more than the four-week moving average of 1.862 million. Meanwhile the number of initial claims for the week ending Aug. 3, 2024 is 233.000 lower than the four-week moving average of 240.750. The chart created by @dimartino2024 shows more details about the indicator.\n\n![](images/clipboard-465393918.png)\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidyquant)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\n#Continued Claims (Insured Unemployment) from FRED\ndata_continuos_claims <-  tq_get(\"CCSA\", get = \"economic.data\")\n\ndata_end <- data_continuos_claims %>% tail(1)\n\ndata_continuos_claims %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = price))+\n  geom_line(linewidth = 0.5,\n            color = \"navy\")+\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    labels = label_number(scale_cut = cut_short_scale())\n  )+\n  geom_text_repel(\n    aes(label = price,\n        hjust = 1),\n    data = data_end\n  )+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  labs(title = \"Continued Claims (Insured Unemployment)\",\n       caption = \"Source: FRED\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](macroeconomic_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n-   Another importat indicator about labor market is Aggregate hours worked. The chart below shows the average weekly hours of all employees, total private from FRED. The first thing you see when the economy is slowing down is a reduction in job openings. That is the first wave. The secong wave that you see is the number of hours worked. And that is a very important metric because when you're cutting hours, the next step is to actually cut positions.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Average weekly hours of all employees, total private ()\ndata_wk_hours <-  tq_get(\"AWHAETP\", get = \"economic.data\")\n\ndata_end_wk_hours <- data_wk_hours %>% tail(1)\n\ndata_wk_hours %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = price))+\n  geom_line(linewidth = 0.5, \n            color = \"navy\")+\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    labels = label_number(scale_cut = cut_short_scale())\n  )+\n  geom_text_repel(\n    aes(label = price),\n    data = data_end_wk_hours\n  )+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  labs(title = \"Average weekly hours of all employees, total private\",\n       caption = \"Source: FRED\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](macroeconomic_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Table B-2.

Generally, in these cycles, highly leveraged companies tend to file for bankruptcy which are important to observe, mainly due to volatility. The perception of high interest rates and monetary tightening make it difficult to pass on prices to the consumer, leading business to adjust their process searching for efficiency.\n\n-   Temporary rise in unemployment rates but without abrupt movements. The job losses begin at the lowest rungs in terms of skills, educational attainment, income making capacity. This indicators are being closely monitored by FED officials and the reflection can be seen in Mr. Powell's speeches.\n\n-   Actions to improve the efficiency of costs(COGS) and operating expenses(SG&A) by companies.\n\n-   Temporary increase in the cost of capital for privet debt.\n\n-   Supply chain reorganization.\n\n-   Increase of risk of plain vanilla recession\n\n#### Agroindustry: dairy sector adjustments, machines (e.g. John Deer).\n\n-   here\n\n#### Auto industry: sales, operation results, investments, and projections\n\n-   here\n\n![Auto sales by brand 2Q24](img/auto_results_24.jpg)\n\n#### Transportation: carrier population, tender rejections, volume, capacity.\n\nThere was overcapacity in carrier population during the period from 2020 to 2023 due to demand that has been inconsistent over time and is currently undergoing adjustments. However, capacity still presents high values in relation to valumes and demand, pressuring agents to adjust their operations in search for efficiency gains. Some of those carriers are contracting reducing their fleets sizes in order to move forward. On the other side the carriers population are reduced in 32.500 from december of 2022 to june of 2024.\n\n-   Tender rejections are currently in 4.5%, and diesel prices are \\$3.81 per gallon on average.\n\n-   Dry van in spot market currently \\$1.96 per mile 0.2% YoY and -11.5% over five years. Overcapacity more concentrated in Atlanta, GA.\n\n-   Reefer in spot market currently \\$2.30 per mile -1% YoY and -9% over five years.\n\n-   Flat bed in spot market currently \\$2.34 per mile -1% YoY and -7% over five years.\n\n#### Technology: growth, AI, balance sheet adjustments, labor force,\n\n-   here\n\n#### Construction:index, prices, new home sales, labor force, permits, projections.\n\n-   here\n\n#### Manufacturing:sector, investments, construction site, infraestructute, training, labor force.\n\n-   here\n\nSource: CNBC, The week in Agribusiness, The Autoline Daily, Bloomberg, Trucking Made Successful,\n",
