The direction of travel is clear and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data the envolving outlook and the balance of risks. We will do everything we can to support a strong labor market as we made further progress toward price stability.\n>\n> â€” Jerome Powell\n\nSource: [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications.htm)\n\n### [**Labor**]{style=\"color: #9D0F6A ;\"}\n\n-   One important indicator of labor market is the continuing claims that track the number of residents filing for ongoing unemployment benefits in a given week. The number of continuing claims for the week ending Aug 3, 2024 is 1.864 million. That is slightly more than the four-week moving average of 1.862 million. Meanwhile the number of initial claims for the week ending Aug. 3, 2024 is 233.000 lower than the four-week moving average of 240.750. The chart created by @dimartino2024 shows more details about the indicator.\n\n![](images/clipboard-465393918.png)\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](macroeconomic_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n-   Another importat labor market indicator is Aggregate hours worked. The chart below shows the average weekly hours of all employees, total private from FRED. The first thing you see when the economy is slowing down is a reduction in job openings. That is the first wave. The secong wave that you see is the number of hours worked. And that is a very important metric because when you're cutting hours, the next step is to actually cut positions.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](macroeconomic_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nSource: Federal Reserve and [U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/) and [U.S. Departament of Labor](https://www.dol.gov)\n\n### [**10-Year Treasury bonds**]{style=\"color: #9D0F6A ;\"}\n\n-   United States Central Bank Rate stands at 5.50%, following the most recent adjustment in july 2023.\n-   The chart below shows the United States 10-Year Government Bond yield\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](macroeconomic_files/figure-html/bonds_10y-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nSource: [Yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/), [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS10/)\n\n### [**10Y3M curve**]{style=\"color: #9D0F6A ;\"}\n\n-   The spread between United States 10-Year and 3-Months is -136.6 basis points(bp)\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](macroeconomic_files/figure-html/yield_curve-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nSource: [FRED - Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/)\n\n### [**Overview 2Q24**]{style=\"color: #9D0F6A ;\"}\n\n#### [**Overall**]{style=\"color: #9D0F6A ;\"}\n\nRevenue's cash flow is a challenge which has a short-term effect on supply chains, labor market and debt costs as some of them are backed by revenue. Generally, in these cycles, highly leveraged companies tend to file for bankruptcy which are important to observe, mainly due to volatility. The perception of high interest rates and monetary tightening make it difficult to pass on prices to the consumer, leading business to adjust their process searching for efficiency.\n\n-   Temporary rise in unemployment rates but without abrupt movements. The job losses begin at the lowest rungs in terms of skills, educational attainment, income making capacity. This indicators are being closely monitored by FED officials and the reflection can be seen in Mr. Powell's speeches.\n\n-   Actions to improve the efficiency of costs(COGS) and operating expenses(SG&A) by companies.\n\n-   Temporary increase in the cost of capital for privet debt.\n\n-   Supply chain reorganization.\n\n-   Increase of risk of plain vanilla recession\n\n#### [**Agroindustry: dairy sector adjustments, machines (e.g. John Deer).**]{style=\"color: #9D0F6A ;\"}\n\n-   here\n\n#### [**Auto industry: sales, operation results, investments, and projections**]{style=\"color: #9D0F6A ;\"}\n\n-   here\n\n![Auto sales by brand 2Q24](img/auto_results_24.jpg)\n\n#### [**Transportation: carrier population, tender rejections, volume, capacity**]{style=\"color: #9D0F6A ;\"}\n\nThere was overcapacity in carrier population during the period from 2020 to 2023 due to demand that has been inconsistent over time and is currently undergoing adjustments. However, capacity still presents high values in relation to valumes and demand, pressuring agents to adjust their operations in search for efficiency gains. Some of those carriers are contracting reducing their fleets sizes in order to move forward. On the other side the carriers population are reduced in 32.500 from december of 2022 to june of 2024.\n\n-   Tender rejections are currently in 4.5%, and diesel prices are \\$3.81 per gallon on average.\n\n-   Dry van in spot market currently \\$1.96 per mile 0.2% YoY and -11.5% over five years.
