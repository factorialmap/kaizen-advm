Drivers are consumer spending, private inventory investment, and nonresidential fixed investment.\n\n-   Personal income increased \\$237.6 billion in the second quarter, compared with an increase of \\$396.8 billion in the first quarter.\n\n-   Personal saving increased \\$186.3 billion or 3.6%. Personal saving rate as a percentage of disposable personal income was 3.5% in the second quarter, compared with 3.8% in the first quarter.\n\n-   Personal consumption expenditures: % Change from Proceding Period was 2.3%, compared with 1.4% in the first quarter.\n\n-   Gross private domestic investment: % Change from Proceding Period was 8.4% in the second quarter , compared with 4.4% in the first quarter.\n\n-   Government consumption expenditures and gross investment: % Change from Proceding Period was 3.1% in the second quarter compared with 1.8% in the first quarter.\n\nSource: [Bureau of Economic Analysis](https://www.bea.gov/)\n\n### [**Inflation**]{style=\"color: #9D0F6A ;\"}\n\n-   The annual inflation rate for the United Stats was 2.9 for the 12 months ending July, compared to the previius rate increase of 3%, acording to U.S. Labor Departament data published on August 14, 2024.\n\n-   The next inflation update is scheduled for release on September 11, 2024.\n\n![](images/clipboard-2010062285.png)\n\nSource: [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications.htm)\n\n### [**Interest rates**]{style=\"color: #9D0F6A ;\"}\n\n-   United States Central Bank Rate stands at 5.50%, following the most recent adjustment in july 2023.\n-   In Aug-23, 2024 Mr. Jerome Powell\n\n> The time has come for policy to adjust. The direction of travel is clear and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data the envolving outlook and the balance of risks. We will do everything we can to support a strong labor market as we made further progress toward price stability.\n>\n> â€” Jerome Powell\n\nSource: [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications.htm)\n\n### [**Labor**]{style=\"color: #9D0F6A ;\"}\n\n-   One important indicator of labor market is the continuing claims that track the number of residents filing for ongoing unemployment benefits in a given week. The number of continuing claims for the week ending Aug 3, 2024 is 1.864 million. That is slightly more than the four-week moving average of 1.862 million. Meanwhile the number of initial claims for the week ending Aug. 3, 2024 is 233.000 lower than the four-week moving average of 240.750. The chart created by @dimartino2024 shows more details about the indicator.\n\n![](images/clipboard-465393918.png)\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](macroeconomic_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n-   Another importat labor market indicator is Aggregate hours worked. The chart below shows the average weekly hours of all employees, total private from FRED. The first thing you see when the economy is slowing down is a reduction in job openings. That is the first wave. The secong wave that you see is the number of hours worked. And that is a very important metric because when you're cutting hours, the next step is to actually cut positions.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](macroeconomic_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nSource: Federal Reserve and [U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/) and [U.S. Departament of Labor](https://www.dol.gov)\n\n### [**10-Year Treasury bonds**]{style=\"color: #9D0F6A ;\"}\n\n-   United States Central Bank Rate stands at 5.50%, following the most recent adjustment in july 2023.\n-   The chart below shows the United States 10-Year Government Bond yield\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](macroeconomic_files/figure-html/bonds_10y-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nSource: [Yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/), [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS10/)\n\n### [**10Y3M curve**]{style=\"color: #9D0F6A ;\"}\n\n-   The spread between United States 10-Year and 3-Months is -136.6 basis points(bp)\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](macroeconomic_files/figure-html/yield_curve-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nSource: [FRED - Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/)\n\n### [**Sectors 2Q24**]{style=\"color: #9D0F6A ;\"}\n\n#### [**Overall**]{style=\"color: #9D0F6A ;\"}\n\nRevenue's cash flow is a challenge which has a short-term effect on supply chains, labor market and debt costs as some of them are backed by revenue. Generally, in these cycles, highly leveraged companies tend to file for bankruptcy which are important to observe, mainly due to volatility. The perception of high interest rates and monetary tightening make it difficult to pass on prices to the consumer, leading business to adjust their process searching for efficiency.\n\n-   Temporary rise in unemployment rates but without abrupt movements. The job losses begin at the lowest rungs in terms of skills, educational attainment, income making capacity. This indicators are being closely monitored by FED officials and the reflection can be seen in Mr. Powell's speeches.\n\n-   Actions to improve the efficiency of costs(COGS) and operating expenses(SG&A) by companies.\n\n-   Temporary increase in the cost of capital for privet debt.\n\n-   Supply chain reorganization.\n\n-   Increase of risk of plain vanilla recession\n\n#### [**Agroindustry:**]{style=\"color: #9D0F6A ;\"}\n\n-   2023 was an incredible year for agriculture, with high productivity for wheat and corn. In 2024, the harvest is a little late in South Dakota area for example. There was high intensity of rainfall at the beginning of planting with mild temperatutes, causing the crop not to develop as much as in 2023. During the what harvest, usually in August, the corn needs rain to fill the grain, but this year there was not much rain during this period.\n\n-   The distortions generated during the pandemic make 2024 a year of adjusments that are being faced by producers, the agricultural manufacturing industry, the sale of machinery and equipment temporarily affeting jobs.\n\n-   As for agricultural prices, they are still not good. The expectation is not for a bad year, but it will not be as good as 2023. Sales of new equipment have fallen, making it necessary to adjust costs and expenses in companies such as John Deer and CNH industrial.\n\n#### [**Auto industry: sales, operation results, investments, and projections**]{style=\"color: #9D0F6A ;\"}\n\n-   The autoindustry faces many challenges in 2024. Slowdown in growth, increased competition and distortions in and supply chain caused during the pandemic and business decisions caused distortions in costs and prices that grew way above the population's income and general inflation rates. This process may take a few years to stabilize.\n\n-   Another phenomemon observed is that the volume of new car sales does not follow the same trend as population growth. It requires a deeper analysis to identify cause-and-effect relationships, but for now, the hypotheses raised are accessibility and the durability of the vehicles @autolinenetwork2024.\n\n    -   Prices: Historically, it takes 25 weeks of average household income to buy a new vehicle. The average household income in 2024 is \\$75.000(\\$1.400 per week) which would be enough to buy a vehicle worth \\$36.000 dollars.\n\n    -   Age of Vehicles: The average age of vehicle on the road in the United States is 12.6 years acording to @parekh2024\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](macroeconomic_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n-   Adjustments in scale, costs, processes, and supply chain econsystems are refleted in the companies' financial results, which are already starting to become tighter.\n\n![Auto sales by brand 2Q24](img/auto_results_24.jpg)\n\n\n- Reducing costs and prices, increasing household income, and finding more sources of revenue such as subscription services are some options that can be observed in the market.\n\n#### [**Transportation: carrier population, tender rejections, volume, capacity**]{style=\"color: #9D0F6A ;\"}\n\nThere was overcapacity in carrier population during the period from 2020 to 2023 due to demand that has been inconsistent over time and is currently undergoing adjustments. However, capacity still presents high values in relation to valumes and demand, pressuring agents to adjust their operations in search for efficiency gains. Some of those carriers are contracting reducing their fleets sizes in order to move forward. On the other side the carriers population are reduced in 32.500 from december of 2022 to june of 2024.\n\n-   Tender rejections are currently in 4.5%, and diesel prices are \\$3.81 per gallon on average.\n\n-   Dry van in spot market currently \\$1.96 per mile 0.2% YoY and -11.5% over five years. Overcapacity more concentrated in Atlanta, GA.\n\n-   Reefer in spot market currently \\$2.30 per mile -1% YoY and -9% over five years.\n\n-   Flat bed in spot market currently \\$2.34 per mile -1% YoY and -7% over five years.\n\n#### [**Technology: growth, AI, balance sheet adjustments, labor force**]{style=\"color: #9D0F6A ;\"}\n\n-   here\n\n#### [**Construction:index, prices, new home sales, labor force, permits, projections**]{style=\"color: #9D0F6A ;\"}\n\n-   here\n\n#### [**Manufacturing:sector, investments, construction site, infraestructute, training, labor force**]{style=\"color: #9D0F6A ;\"}\n\n-   here\n\n",
