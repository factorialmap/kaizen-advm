The Federal Reserve aims for a 2% PCE inflation rate in the long term.\n\n-   PCE inflation measures prices of goods and services consumed by households and nonprofit institutions, and includes food, energy, housing etc. The PCE inflation is more comprehensive than CPI(consume price index). The PCE inflation includes spending directly by households(you pay), and on behalf of households(someone pays for you). For example: When your employer provides health insurance, government provides medicare etc.\n\n**Last update**: February, 2025\nSouce: [Bureau of Economic Analysis](https://www.bea.gov)\n\n**Core PCE Inflation**\n\n-   For January 2025, the Core PCE price index increased 2.6% from the same month one year ago, compared with an increase of 4.1 in 2023:T7.\n\n-   Core PCE index is considered a more stable measure of inflation, exclude food and energy prices due to their volatility, focuses on underlying inflation trends, and provides a better understanding of inflationary pressures.\n\n**Last update**: February, 2025\nSouce: [Bureau of Economic Analysis](https://www.bea.gov)\n\n**CPI (Consumer Price Index)**\n\n-   The annual inflation rate for the United States was 3% for the 12 months ending January 2025, compared to the previus rate of 2.9%, acording to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\n\n-   CPI measures the average change in prices of a basket of good and services and often used for cost of living adjustments, wage negotiations, social security benefits. Only counts out-of-pocket expenditures(you pay directly)\n\n-   The CPI price index for January 2025 increased 0.5% from the preceding month.\n\n| Item        | MoM | YoY  |\n|-------------|-----|------|\n| CPI overall | 0.5 | 3.0  |\n| Food        | 0.4 | 2.5  |\n| Energy      | 1.1 | 1.0  |\n| Services    | 0.5 | 4.3  |\n| Shelter     | 0.4 | 4.4  |\n\n-   The CPI for February 2025 is scheduled to be released on March 12, 2025, at 08:30 a.m. (ET).\n\n**Last update:** January, 2025. \nSource: [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/)\n\n-   From the same month over year ago, the consumer price index (CPI) for January increased 3.0%, acording to Federal Reserve Economic Data.\n\n![](images/clipboard-2010062285.png) \n**Last update:** February, 2025. \nSource: [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications.htm)\n\n## [**Interest rates**]{style=\"color: #9D0F6A ;\"}\n\n-   United States Central Bank Rate stands at 4.50%, following the most recent adjustment in January 2025.\n\n> Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. We see the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals as being roughly in balance, and we're attentive to the risks to both sides of our mandate.\n>\n> Longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, business, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.\n>\n> Over the course of our three previous meetings, we lowered our policy rate by a full percentage point from its peak. That recalibration of our policy stance was appropriate in light of the progress on inflation and the rebalancing in the labor market. With our policy stance significantly less restrictive than it had been, and the economy remaining strong, we do need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance. At today's meeting, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent.\n>\n> We know that reducing policy restraint too fast or too much could hinder progress on inflation. At the same time, reducing policy restraint too slowly or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment. In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. We are not on any preset course.\n>\n> — Jerome Powell, January 29, 2025.\n\n-   There was a signal in the Jackson Hole's speech, which marked the end of the four-year cycle of increase in the interest rates by the FED.\n\n-   The new cycle attempts to normalize economy, including indicators like the U.S. interest rate curve, according to the averages of the last hundred years.\n\n-   The decision demonstrates FED's concern for the lower end of the labor market, while de high end is still very tight.\n\n> Normality is a positively sloped yield curve and we think the terminal rate in FED funds is 3%. Where should 10 years be if we're at 3%? We should at least be 100 to 150 basis point positively sloped.\n>\n> — Gary Cohn, VP of IBM\n\n-   Some indicators that may be evaluated during 2025 are:\n\n    -   Oil.\n\n    -   Commodities.\n\n    -   Shelter (new tenant rents vs old tenant rents).\n\nChair Powell on a question from Elizabeth Schulze of ABC News(December meeting, 2024). Why do you think it is that inflation is proving to be more stubborn than you'd expected?\n\n> I think people are feeling right now is the effect of high prices, not high inflation. So we understand very well that prices went up by a great deal and people really feel that. And it's prices of food and transportation, and heating your home, and things like that, so there's tremendous pain in that burst of inflation that was very global. This was everywhere in all the advanced economies at the same time. So now we have inflation itself is way down but people are still feeling high prices and that is really what people are feeling. The best we can do for them, and that's who we work for, is to get inflation back down to its target and keep it there so that people are earning big, real wage increase so that their wages are going up, their compensation is going up faster than inflation year upon year upon year, and that's what will restore people's good feeling about the economy.\n>\n> That's what it will take, and that's what we're aiming for.\n>\n> — Jerome Powell, December meeting 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](macroeconomic_files/figure-html/fed_funds-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n**Last update:** January, 2025.

Retail trade added jobs in December, following a job loss in Novermber 2024.\n\n-   Unemployment rate in December, 2024 is 4.1% or 6.9 million people. The long-term unemployed(\\>27 weeks or more) was 1.6 million up by 278 thousand from a year earlier that represents 22.4% of all unemployed people.\n\n-   The labor force participation rate in December 2024 was 62.5%, was unchanged over the month and has remained in a narrow range of 62.5% to 62.7% since December 2023.\n\n-   One important indicator of labor market is the continuing claims that track the number of residents filing for ongoing unemployment benefits in a given week. The number of continuing claims in December, 2024 is 1.86 million.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](macroeconomic_files/figure-html/continued_claims-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n-   Another importat labor market indicator is aggregate hours worked. The chart below shows the average weekly hours of all employees, total private. The first thing you see when the economy is slowing down is a reduction in job openings. That is the first wave. The secong wave that you see is the number of hours worked. And that is a very important metric because when you're cutting hours, the next step is to actually cut positions.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](macroeconomic_files/figure-html/weekly_hours_work-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n**Last update:** January, 2025.

Is the interest rate the U.S. government pays to borrow money for a decade, serving as a benchmark for other interest rates, influences borrowing costs, impacts the valuation of financial assets, and signals expectations about inflation and economic growth.\n\n-   The chart below shows the United States 10-Year Government Bond yield.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](macroeconomic_files/figure-html/bonds_10y-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](macroeconomic_files/figure-html/spread_10y_corp-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: [Yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/), [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS10/)\n\n## [**Yield Curve**]{style=\"color: #9D0F6A ;\"}\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](macroeconomic_files/figure-html/yield_curve-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: [FRED - Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/)\n\n## [**Sectors 2Q24**]{style=\"color: #9D0F6A ;\"}\n\n### [**Overall**]{style=\"color: #9D0F6A ;\"}\n\nRevenue cash flow remains a challenge that has effect on supply chains, labor market and debt costs, as some of these are backed by revenue. Generally, in these cycles, highly leveraged companies tend to file for bankruptcy which are important to observe, mainly due to volatility. The perception of high interest rates and monetary tightening make it difficult to pass on prices to the consumer, leading business to adjust their processes striving for efficiency. Other behaviors:\n\n-   Temporary rise in unemployment rates, however without sudden moviments. The job losses begin at the lowest rungs in terms of skills, educational attainment, income making capacity. This indicators are being closely monitored by FED officials and the signals can be seen in Mr. Powell's statements.\n\n-   Decisions by companies towards reducing costs(COGS) and operating expenses(SG&A).\n\n-   Temporary increase in the cost of capital for privet debt.\n\n-   Supply chain reorganization.\n\n### [**Agroindustry**]{style=\"color: #9D0F6A ;\"}\n\n-   2023 was an incredible year for agriculture, with high productivity for wheat and corn. In 2024, the harvest is a little late(e.g South Dakota area). There was high intensity of rainfall at the beginning of planting with mild temperatutes, causing the crop not to develop as much as in 2023. During the wheat harvest, usually in August, the corn needs more rain to fill the grain, but this year there was not so much during this period.\n\n-   The distortions generated during the pandemic is make 2024 a year of adjusments that are being faced by growers, agricultural auto manufacturing, and machinery and equipment sales, temporarily affeting jobs.\n\n-   Looking for agricultural prices, they are still not good. The expectation is not for a bad year, but it will not be as good as 2023. Sales of new equipment have fallen, making it necessary to adjust costs and expenses in companies such as John Deer and CNH industrial.\n\n### [**Automotive**]{style=\"color: #9D0F6A ;\"}\n\n-   The automotive industry faces many challenges in 2024. Slowing growth, increased competition, supply chain disruptions generated during the pandemic and business decisions caused distortions in costs and prices that grew way above the population's income and general inflation rates. This process may take a few years to stabilize.\n\n-   The volume of new car sales does not follow the same trend as population growth. It requires a deeper analysis to identify cause-and-effect relationships, but for now, the hypotheses raised are accessibility and the durability of the vehicles acording to @autolinenetwork2024.\n\n    -   From a price perspective, historically, it takes 25 weeks of average household income to buy a new vehicle. The average household income in 2024 is \\$75.000 (\\$1.400 per week) which would be enough to buy a vehicle worth \\$36.000 dollars.\n\n    -   The age of the vehicles on the road in the United States is 12.6 years acording to @parekh2024\n\n    -   The average cost of car ownership in 2024 was around \\$12,000 annually according to BLS (vehicle purchase 46%, fuels 22%, finance charges 3%, repairs 8%, insurance 15%, others 6%)\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](macroeconomic_files/figure-html/vehicles-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n-   Financial data from auto industry in the second quarter of 2024.\n\n![Auto sales by brand 2Q24](img/auto_results_24.jpg)\n\n-   Reducing costs and prices, increasing household income, and finding more sources of revenue such as subscription services are some options that can be observed in the market.\n\n-   Some car manufacturers are discovering and applying new materials that that awaken the perception of confort and refinement in consumers and this has been reflected in their choices.\n\n### [**Transportation**]{style=\"color: #9D0F6A ;\"}\n\nThere was overcapacity in carrier population during the period from 2020 to 2023 due to demand that has been inconsistent over time and is currently undergoing adjustments. However, capacity still presents high values in relation to volumes pressuring agents to adjust their operations in striving for efficiency gains. Some of those carriers are contracting and reducing their fleets sizes in order to move forward. On the other side the carriers population are reduced in 33.200 from december of 2022 to october of 2024. February is historically one of the slowest month in the trucking industry however when comparing year-over-year data the volumes(except flat-bed) and rates(all those three equipment types) in the general market are down\n\n-   Tender rejections are currently in 5.65% in February 2025 compare to 4.5% in June 2024.\n\n-   Diesel prices are \\$3.69 per gallon in February 2025, -3.1% compare to \\$3.81 per gallon in june 2024.\n\n-   Dry van in spot market currently \\$1.92 per mile -5% YoY and -13.2% over five years(\\$2.22-2019).\n\n-   Reefer in spot market currently \\$2.23 per mile -5% YoY and -11.8% over five years(\\$2.53-2019).\n\n-   Flat bed in spot market currently \\$2.27 per mile -2.4% YoY and -9.8% over five years(\\$2.52-2019).\n\n**Last update:** February, 2025\n\n### [**Technology**]{style=\"color: #9D0F6A ;\"}\n\n-   In 2025 investments in disruptive technologies continue to show accelerated growth. The highlight has been in data center, generative AI for the cloud, personal computers, smartphone devices, and factory floor which is unlocking possibilities for innovation between interconnected processes such as robotics, augmented reality, and autonomous vehicles.\n\n-   Factors such as macroeconomic, geopolitical environment, and intense competition influence the adoption of technology as alternatives to improve operational efficiency in business.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](macroeconomic_files/figure-html/machine_learning-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n-   The innovation process has accelerated, driven by the development of large generative AI models, known as foundation models. These foundation models are then utilized by specialized applications that build upon them to perform more specific tasks. Finally, traditional processes are leveraging the applications to achieve efficiency gains, create new processes, and develop new value-added products.\n\n**Infraestructure**\n\n-   **Computing:** Amazon, Google, xAi, Microsoft, Nvidia, (OpenAi, Oracle, Softbank)\n\n-   **AI foundation models:** OpenAI(Msft), Anthropic(Google/Amazon), Cohere(Nvidia), Grok-3(xAi),Gemini-2(Google), DeepSeek-R1(DeepSeek)\n\n-   **AI Software Service:** Palantir\n\n-   **Synthetic data:** Hazy(Microsoft), Sogeti, Epistemix, Mostly AI, Facteus, Sythesis AI, Datavant, Statice, TonicAI, SBX Robotics.\n\n-   **Data Annotation:** Scale AI, Appen, Openxcell, SuperAnnotate, iMerit, Labelbox, Cogitobox, CloudFactory, Hive\n\n**Horizontal AI**\n\nHorizontal AI refers to AI systems that have a broad range of capabilities and can be applied across multiple industries, domais, or tasks.
