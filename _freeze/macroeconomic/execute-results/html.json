There was a 10.8% increase in equipment in the third quarter, compared to 9.8% in the second quarter.\n\n-   Government consumption expenditures and gross investment(% change from proceding period) was 5.1% in the third quarter compared with 3.1% in the second quarter.\n\nSource: [Bureau of Economic Analysis](https://www.bea.gov/)\n\n## [**Inflation**]{style=\"color: #9D0F6A ;\"}\n\nThe United States uses various measures to track inflation, and understanding the differences between them is important.\n\n**PCE Inflation**\n\n-   PCE price index for November 2024 increased 2.4% compared to the same month of 2023.The Federal Reserve targets PCE inflation at 2% over longer run.\n\n-   PCE inflation measures prices of goods and services consumed by households and nonprofit institutions, includes food, energy, housing etc and is more comprehensive than CPI(consume price index). Includes spending directly by households(you pay), and on behalf of households(someone pays for you exemple your employer provides health insurance, government provides medicare etc.)\n\nSouce: [Bureau of Economic Analysis](https://www.bea.gov)\n\n**Core PCE Inflation**\n\n-   Core PCE index for November 2024 increased 2.8 compared to the same month of 2023.\n\n-   Core PCE index is considered a more stable measure of inflation, exclude food and energy prices due to their volatility, focuses on underlying inflation trends, and provides a better understanding of inflationary pressures.\n\nSouce: [Bureau of Economic Analysis](https://www.bea.gov)\n\n**CPI (Consumer Price Index)**\n\n-   The annual inflation rate for the United States was 2.7% for the 12 months ending November, compared to the previus rate increase of 2.6%, acording to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data published on December 11, 2024.\n\n-   CPI measures the average change in prics of a basket of good and services and often used for cost of living adjustments, wage negotiations, social security benefits. Only counts out-of-pocket expenditures(you pay directly)\n\n-   The CPI price index for October increased 0.2% from the preceding month.\n\n| Item        | MoM | YoY  |\n|-------------|-----|------|\n| CPI overall | 0.3 | 2.7  |\n| Food        | 0.4 | 2.4  |\n| Energy      | 0.2 | -3.2 |\n| Services    | 0.3 | 4.6  |\n| Shelter     | 0.3 | 4.7  |\n\n-   The CPI for November 2024 is scheduled to be released on January 15, 2025, at 08:30 a.m. (ET).\n\nSource: [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/)\n\n-   From the same month over year ago, the consumer price index (CPI) for October increased 2.73%, acording to Federal Reserve Economic Data.\n\n![](images/clipboard-2010062285.png)\n\nSource: [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications.htm)\n\n## [**Interest rates**]{style=\"color: #9D0F6A ;\"}\n\n-   United States Central Bank Rate stands at 4.50%, following the most recent adjustment in December 2024.\n\n> Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. We see the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals as being roughly in balance, and we're attentive to the risks to both sides of our mandate.\n>\n> At today's meeting, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point, to 4 1/4 percent to 4 1/5 percent. We have been moving policy toward a more neutral setting in order to maintain the strength of the economy and the labor market while enabling further progress on inflation.\n>\n> With today's action, we have lowered our policy rate by a full percentage point from its peak, and our policy stance is now significantly less restrictive. We can therefore be more cautious as we consider further adjustments to our policy rate.\n>\n> We know that reducing policy restraint too fast or too much could hinder progress on inflation. At the same time, reducing policy restraint too slowly or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.\n>\n> In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.\n>\n> — Jerome Powell\n\n-   There was a signal in the Jackson Hole's speech, which marked the end of the four-year cycle of increase in the interest rates by the FED.\n\n-   The new cycle attempts to normalize economy, including indicators like the U.S. interest rate curve, according to the averages of the last hundred years.\n\n-   The decision demonstrates FED's concern for the lower end of the labor market, while de high end is still very tight.\n\n> Normality is a positively sloped yield curve and we think the terminal rate in FED funds is 3%. Where should 10 years be if we're at 3%? We should at least be 100 to 150 basis point positively sloped.\n>\n> — Gary Cohn, VP of IBM\n\n-   Some indicators that may be evaluated during the next three months are:\n\n    -   Oil.\n\n    -   Commodities.\n\n    -   Shelter 2025 (new tenant rents vs old tenant rents).\n\n> I think people are feeling right now is the effect of high prices, not high inflation. So we understand very well that prices went up by a great deal and people really feel that. And it's prices of food and transportation, and heating your home, and things like that, so there's tremendous pain in that burst of inflation that was very global. This was everywhere in all the advanced economies at the same time. So now we have inflation itself is way down but people are still feeling high prices and that is really what people are feeling. The best we can do for them, and that's who we work for, is to get inflation back down to its target and keep it theres so that people are earning big, real wage increase so that their wages are going up, their compensation is going up faster than inflation year upon year upon year, and that's what will restore people's good feeling about the economy.\n>\n> That's what it will take, and that's what we're aiming for.\n>\n> — Jerome Powell\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](macroeconomic_files/figure-html/fed_funds-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nSource: [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications.htm)\n\n## [**Labor Market**]{style=\"color: #9D0F6A ;\"}\n\n-   Total nonnfarm payroll employment rose by 227k in November trended up in hearth care, leisure and hospitality, government, and social assistance, meanwhile retail trade are down.\n\n-   Unemployment rate in November, 2024 is 4.2% or 7.1 million people a little higher than a year earlier when jobless rate was 3.7% and number of unemployed people was 6.3 million. The long-term unemployed(\\>27 weeks) was 1.7 million up ffrom 1.2 million a year earlier that represents 23.2% of all unemployed people.\n\n-   The labor force participation rate was 62.5%\n\n-   One important indicator of labor market is the continuing claims that track the number of residents filing for ongoing unemployment benefits in a given week. The number of continuing claims for the week ending September 21, 2024 is 1.826 million. Less than the four-week moving average of 1.829 million. Meanwhile the number of initial claims for the week ending sep. 21, 2024 was 225.000 very close the four-week moving average of 224,250.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](macroeconomic_files/figure-html/continued_claims-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n-   Another importat labor market indicator is aggregate hours worked. The chart below shows the average weekly hours of all employees, total private. The first thing you see when the economy is slowing down is a reduction in job openings. That is the first wave. The secong wave that you see is the number of hours worked. And that is a very important metric because when you're cutting hours, the next step is to actually cut positions.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](macroeconomic_files/figure-html/weekly_hours_work-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nSource: Federal Reserve and [U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/) and [U.S. Departament of Labor](https://www.dol.gov)\n\n## [**10-Year Treasury bonds**]{style=\"color: #9D0F6A ;\"}\n\n-   United States Central Bank Rate stands at 4.75%, following the most recent adjustment in November 2024.\n\n-   The chart below shows the United States 10-Year Government Bond yield.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](macroeconomic_files/figure-html/bonds_10y-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nSource: [Yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/), [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS10/)\n\n## [**Yield Curve**]{style=\"color: #9D0F6A ;\"}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](macroeconomic_files/figure-html/yield_curve-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nSource: [FRED - Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/)\n\n## [**Sectors 2Q24**]{style=\"color: #9D0F6A ;\"}\n\n### [**Overall**]{style=\"color: #9D0F6A ;\"}\n\nRevenue's cash flow is a challenge which has a short-term effect on supply chains, labor market, and debt costs as some of them are backed by revenue. Generally, in these cycles, highly leveraged companies tend to file for bankruptcy which are important to observe, mainly due to volatility. The perception of high interest rates and monetary tightening make it difficult to pass on prices to the consumer, leading business to adjust their processes striving for efficiency. Other behaviors:\n\n-   Temporary rise in unemployment rates, however without sudden moviments. The job losses begin at the lowest rungs in terms of skills, educational attainment, income making capacity. This indicators are being closely monitored by FED officials and the signals can be seen in Mr. Powell's statements.\n\n-   Decisions by companies towards reducing costs(COGS) and operating expenses(SG&A).\n\n-   Temporary increase in the cost of capital for privet debt.\n\n-   Supply chain reorganization.\n\n### [**Agroindustry**]{style=\"color: #9D0F6A ;\"}\n\n-   2023 was an incredible year for agriculture, with high productivity for wheat and corn. In 2024, the harvest is a little late(e.g South Dakota area). There was high intensity of rainfall at the beginning of planting with mild temperatutes, causing the crop not to develop as much as in 2023. During the wheat harvest, usually in August, the corn needs more rain to fill the grain, but this year there was not so much during this period.\n\n-   The distortions generated during the pandemic is make 2024 a year of adjusments that are being faced by growers, agricultural auto manufacturing, and machinery and equipment sales, temporarily affeting jobs.\n\n-   Looking for agricultural prices, they are still not good. The expectation is not for a bad year, but it will not be as good as 2023. Sales of new equipment have fallen, making it necessary to adjust costs and expenses in companies such as John Deer and CNH industrial.\n\n### [**Automotive**]{style=\"color: #9D0F6A ;\"}\n\n-   The automotive industry faces many challenges in 2024. Slowing growth, increased competition, supply chain disruptions generated during the pandemic and business decisions caused distortions in costs and prices that grew way above the population's income and general inflation rates. This process may take a few years to stabilize.\n\n-   The volume of new car sales does not follow the same trend as population growth. It requires a deeper analysis to identify cause-and-effect relationships, but for now, the hypotheses raised are accessibility and the durability of the vehicles acording to @autolinenetwork2024.\n\n    -   From a price perspective, historically, it takes 25 weeks of average household income to buy a new vehicle. The average household income in 2024 is \\$75.000 (\\$1.400 per week) which would be enough to buy a vehicle worth \\$36.000 dollars.\n\n    -   The age of the vehicles on the road in the United States is 12.6 years acording to @parekh2024\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](macroeconomic_files/figure-html/vehicles-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n-   Financial data from auto industry in the second quarter of 2024.\n\n![Auto sales by brand 2Q24](img/auto_results_24.jpg)\n\n-   Reducing costs and prices, increasing household income, and finding more sources of revenue such as subscription services are some options that can be observed in the market.\n\n-   Some car manufacturers are discovering and applying new materials that that awaken the perception of confort and refinement in consumers and this has been reflected in their choices.\n\n### [**Transportation**]{style=\"color: #9D0F6A ;\"}\n\nThere was overcapacity in carrier population during the period from 2020 to 2023 due to demand that has been inconsistent over time and is currently undergoing adjustments. However, capacity still presents high values in relation to volumes pressuring agents to adjust their operations in striving for efficiency gains. Some of those carriers are contracting and reducing their fleets sizes in order to move forward. On the other side the carriers population are reduced in 32.500 from december of 2022 to october of 2024.\n\n-   Tender rejections are currently in 6.20% in December compare to 4.5% in June 2024.\n\n-   Diesel prices are \\$3.58 per gallon in December -6.04% compare to \\$3.81 per gallon in june 2024.\n\n-   Dry van in spot market currently \\$1.96 per mile 0.2% YoY and -11.5% over five years(2019).\n\n-   Reefer in spot market currently \\$2.30 per mile -1% YoY and -9% over five years(2019).\n\n-   Flat bed in spot market currently \\$2.21 per mile -1% YoY and -12% over five years(2019).\n\n### [**Technology**]{style=\"color: #9D0F6A ;\"}\n\n-   In 2024 investments in disruptive technologies continue to show accelerated growth. The highlight has been in generative AI, which is unlocking possibilities for innovation between interconnected processes such as robotics and augmented reality.\n\n-   Factors such as macroeconomic, geopolitical environment, and intense competition influence the adoption of technology as alternatives to improve operational efficiency in business.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](macroeconomic_files/figure-html/machine_learning-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n-   The innovation process has accelerated, driven by the development of large generative AI models, known as foundation models. These foundation models are then utilized by specialized applications that build upon them to perform more specific tasks. Finally, traditional processes are leveraging the applications to achieve efficiency gains, create new processes, and develop new value-added products.\n\n**Infraestructure**\n\n-   **Computing:** Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Nvidia\n\n-   **AI foundation models:** OpenAI(Msft), Anthropic(Google/Amazon), Cohere(Nvidia)\n\n-   **Model development & deployment:** Modular(Google)\n\n-   **Systhetic data:** Hazy(Microsoft)\n\n**Horizontal AI**\n\nHorizontal AI refers to AI systems that have a broad range of capabilities and can be applied across multiple industries, domais, or tasks.
