-   CHIPS and Science Act provide \$52.7 billion for American semiconductor research, development, manufacturing, and workforce development. This includes \$39 billion in manufacturing incentives @hawkins2024

**SMM's - Small, medium manufacturers**

The task here is to research the possibilities in the small and medium manufacturing sector considering the market, historic aspects, and the innovation theory of Bonvillian and Paul Romer.

-   Manufacturing as a service @sendcutsend2024 and @fussell2024

-   Dev kit's serving as a catalyts for creativity and scientific discovery when the innovators can quickly test and validate their hypoteses, fostering a culture of experimentation and risk-taking. By providing access to cutting-edge hardware, these kits empower people from diverse backgrounds to angage in hands-on experimentation and prototyping @breakingtaps2024. This, in turn, enables the rapid iteration and refinement of design concepts, accelerating the journey from idea to reality. As a result, dev kits have become an essential tool for driving innovation, fueling breakthroughs, and pushing the boundaries of what is possIble while creating an environment for exapanding supply chain capabilities and knowledge base @lgarlati2024

**Pharmaceutical Industry**

-   Solid dosage products still account for the majority of medicinal products made worldwide, but there are some hurdles to overcome in order to make the tablet of the future. Issues such as patient centricity, solubility, bioavailability conversion of parental products to solid dosage forms are all topics that need to be addressed.

-   Quality, variability, new processes, supply chain, and inspection

-   Smart pill such as electronic capsule for tageting drug to delivery system.

In 1990, the United States used to be a global leader in manufacturing, but in 2010, China passed the U.S. going from 3.5% in 1990 to 30.5% in 2021.

Apple and Alphabet hire and send thousands of employees abroad to eversea manufacturing. It was common to send 20,40 engineers at a time to the factory to support prototyping builds to do that learning and finding and fixing of issues and be in the right place at the right time. Apple buying 50 business class seats from San Francisco to Shanghai daily, accounting for \$150 million in annual revenue for United Air Lines.

> The popular conception is that companies come to China because of low labor cost. I'm not sure what part of China they go to, but the truth is China stopped being the low labor cost country many years ago and that is not the reason to come to China from a supply point of view. The reason is because of the skill and the quantity of skill in one location and the type of skill it is.

Acording to @helwig2024 , manufacturing is subject to learning effect and making high value-added technology products requires specialized process knowledge and when firms or nations stop producing something, developing that capability again is an uphill battle.

Manufacturing process demand a lot of skill and a lot of local supply chain for where all the parts are going to come from to build such a complex product that makes it a very appealing place to build.

All products of Apple are designed and engineered in US and they all include components manufactured in U.S. (e.g. iPhone glass is made in Kentucky, and lasers that enable Face ID are built in the U.S. too.). In 2023 Apple annouced \$430 billion in new investments across the country, including work with more than nine thousand suppliers across all fifty states in U.S. acording @cnbc2022

In 2012 Google buy Motorola for \$12.5 billion and open smartphone manufacturing plant in Fort Worth Texas to build Moto X. The goals was build as American made low cost smartphone but about a year after it opened, the plant shut down, citing high demestic operating costs and low consumer demand. Google sold Motorola to Lenovo for a multibillion dollar loss. Some experts says the U.S. failure shows that the cost of labor and the lack of skill in the U.S. is why manufacturing in the country is not cost effective.

Foxconn is Apple's largest supplier and the world's largest electronic manufacturer. Acording to @yeung2022 Chairman Terry Gou sayd the core skills and the capabilities of making phones, manufacturing, electronics have moved to Asia and for it to come to America it would be difficult, though not impossible. In 2017, the White House announced Foxconn's plan to invest \$10 billion, and open a massive LCD screen manufacturing facility in Wisconsin creating a 13.000 jobs.

A smartphone made in America cost \$2.000 dollars but the same product made in China cost \$1.300, it's \$700 cheaper than the American-made model. The supply chain doesn't exist. Labor intensive positions is a challange and needs to rebuild.

> I worked and managed manufacturing electronics and semiconductors for 30 years. I’ve visited China on manufacturing activities multiple times. I became management and can see the financial statements. In the 1990’s and early 2000’s, labor cost in Asia was the driver. This drove supply chain to go to Asia, even the most complex manufacturing and less labor intensive like chip manufacturing. So in 2000’s it’s supply chain as driver. In the end, it’s profit margin that is driving the companies to manufacture in Asia, particularly China. The US and Europe have given up even their low labor intensive manufacturing capability (chip foundries) and even design capability (engineers are cheaper in Asia). They could still make a profit by manufacturing in the US, but that profit may be only 10% compared to 30% if made in Asia (mostly China). So the root cause is profit MARGIN, not profit.

-   He talks about Arpa-e energy gov call for proposals propel 1k that refers to on thousand watt hours per kilogram. Today EV's is pushing to 250 watt hours per kilogram. So 1K is about planes, trains and ships. To put in perspective the chemistries that we know of today the top and os about 4 kWh/kg and what we are all trying to do is figure it out how to make those usable low cost enough and by the time you get to a system that exceeds what we're doing today.

Obs: Innolith Switzerland-based company with labs in Germany claims it's on path to 1000 wh/kg or (1kWh/kg) battery energy density to enable the production of vehicles with 620 miles range(1000 km). The oth
