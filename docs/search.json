    "text": "U.S. Inflation\nLast update: September, 2025\nThe United States employs several different methods to monitor inflation, and it is crucial to comprehend the distinctions among these measures to gain a clear understanding of economic trends.\nPCE Inflation\nPCE inflation measures the prices of goods and services consumed by households and nonprofit institutions, including food, energy, housing , and more. It is more comprehensive than the Consumer Price Index (CPI). PCE inflation accounts for both direct household spending (you pay) and spending on behalf of households (someone pays for you). For example, when your employer provides health insurance or the government provides Medicare.\n\nCompared to the same month last year, the PCE price index rose by 2.7% in August 2025 (T7). The Federal Reserve targets a long-term PCE inflation rate of 2%. From the preceding month, the PCE price index increased 0.3% (T5).\nPersonal income rose by 0.4% in August on a monthly basis, according to the estimates published on September 26, 2025 (T3).\n\nCore PCE Inflation\nCore PCE index is considered a more stable measure of inflation, exclude food and energy prices due to their volatility, focuses on underlying inflation trends, and provides a better understanding of inflationary pressures.\n\nWhen compared to the same month in the previous year, the core PCE price index rose by 2.9% in July 2025, which is slightly higher than the 2.8% increase recorded in June, 2025:T7.\n\nSouce: Bureau of Economic Analysis\nCPI (Consumer Price Index)\nLast update: December, 2025.\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the average change in prices for a basket of goods and services. It is often used to adjust the cost of living, negotiate wages, and determine Social Security benefits. CPI only accounts for out-of-pocket expentures(expenses you pay directly)\n\nThe annual inflation rate for the United States increased by 2.7% for the 12 months ending November 2025, compared to the previous rate of 3% in September, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.27% in November 2025 compared to the previous month.\n\n\n\n\nItem\nMoM\nYoY\n\n\n\n\nCPI overall\n-\n2.7\n\n\nFood\n-\n2.6\n\n\nEnergy\n-\n4.2\n\n\nServices\n-\n3.0\n\n\nShelter\n-\n3.0\n\n\n\n\nThe CPI for December 2025 is scheduled to be released on January 13, 2026, at 08:30 a.m. (ET).\n\nSource: Bureau of Labor Statistics\nLast update: December, 2025.\n\nAccording to Federal Roserve Economic data, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increase by 2.71% in November 2025 compared to the same month a year earlier.\n\n\nSource: Federal Reserve",

At today’s meeting, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 3-1/2 to 3-3/4 percent.\nIn the near term, risks to inflation are tilted to the upside and risks to employment to the downside, a challenging situation. There is no risk-free path for policy as we navigate this tension between our employment and inflation goals. A reasonable base case is that the effects of tariffs on &gt; inflation will be relatively short-lived effectively a one-time shift in the price level. Our obligation is to make sure that a one-time increase in the price level does not becoome an ongoing inflation problem. But with downside risks to employment having risen in recent months, the balance of risks has shifted. Our framework calls for us to take a balance approach in promoting both side of our dual mandate.\n— Jerome Powell, December 10, 2025.\n\n\nLast update: January, 2025.\n\nThere was a signal in the Jackson Hole’s speech, which marked the end of the four-year cycle of increase in the interest rates by the FED.\nThe new cycle attempts to normalize economy, including indicators like the U.S. interest rate curve, according to the averages of the last hundred years.\nThe decision demonstrates FED’s concern for the lower end of the labor market, while de high end is still very tight.\n\n\nNormality is a positively sloped yield curve and we think the terminal rate in FED funds is 3%. Where should 10 years be if we’re at 3%? We should at least be 100 to 150 basis point positively sloped.\n— Gary Cohn, VP of IBM\n\n\nSome indicators that may be evaluated during 2025 are:\n\nOil.\nCommodities.\nShelter (new tenant rents vs old tenant rents).\n\n\n\nLast update: January, 2025.\nChair Powell on a question from Elizabeth Schulze of ABC News(December meeting, 2024). Why do you think it is that inflation is proving to be more stubborn than you’d expected?\n\nI think people are feeling right now is the effect of high prices, not high inflation. So we understand very well that prices went up by a great deal and people really feel that. And it’s prices of food and transportation, and heating your home, and things like that, so there’s tremendous pain in that burst of inflation that was very global. This was everywhere in all the advanced economies at the same time. So now we have inflation itself is way down but people are still feeling high prices and that is really what people are feeling. The best we can do for them, and that’s who we work for, is to get inflation back down to its target and keep it there so that people are earning big, real wage increase so that their wages are going up, their compensation is going up faster than inflation year upon year upon year, and that’s what will restore people’s good feeling about the economy.\nThat’s what it will take, and that’s what we’re aiming for.\n— Jerome Powell, December meeting 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Federal Reserve",

    "text": "U.S. Labor Market\nLast update: September, 2025.\n\nThe unemployment rate stood at 4.3% in August 2025. A Job gains in healthcare were partially offset by losses in the federal government and in mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction.\nIn August 2025, the unemployment rate was 4.3%, representing 7.4 million people. Of those, 1.9 million were long-term unemployed(out of work for 27 weeks or more) accounting for 25.7% of all unemployed persons(TA12).\nThe labor force participation rate declined to 62.3% in August 2025 (TA-1), down 0.4 percentage points from the previous year.\nOne important indicator of the labor market is continuing claims, which track the number of individuals filing for ongoing unemployment benefits each week. This indicator is crucial because it reflects the health of the labor market, signal consumer spending strength, helps identify recession risks, informs Reserve policy decisions, and guides business confidence(all in one metric).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother important labor market indicator is aggregate hours worked. The chart below shows the average weekly hours of all employees in the total private sector. One of the first signs of a slowing economy is a reduction in job openings(that’s the first wave). The second wave is a decline in hours worked, which is a critical metric. When employers begin cutting hours, the next step is often cutting positions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor market tightness refers to the number of job vacancies per unemployed worker, and it plays a key role in monetary policy decisions. A very tight labor market may indicate an overheating economy, causing firms to compete for workers and raise wages. If wages grow faster than productivity, inflation can rise. To address this, central banks like the Federal Reserve may increase interest rates to slow down economic activity and reduce labor demand, easing inflation.\nA tight labor market can also promote inclusion by helping groups historically facing employment barriers, as firms become more willing to hire and train them. The Federal Reseve’s average inflation targeting allows lower interest rates during low inflation, supporting a tight labor market and more inclusive job growth.\nThe chart below, shared by Mick Dueholm and Serdar Ozkan on the FRED Blog, illustrates labor market tightness as the ratio of job openings to unemployed individuals. This measure indicates how many job opportunities are available for each person seeking work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics , U.S. Departament of Labor, and FRED.",

It represents the interest rate the U.S. government pays to borrow money for a decade and serves as benchmark for other interest rates. This yield influences borrowing costs, affects the valuation of financial assets, and reflects expectations about inflation and economic growth.\nThe chart below shows the United States 10-Year Government Bond yield.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe spread between Moody’s Baa corporate bond yield and the 10-year Treasury yield is a key measure of credit risk and economic sentiment. It reflects how much extra return investors demand for holding riskier corporate debt over safe government bonds. A widening spread signals rising concern about corporate defaults or economic slowdown, while a narrowing spread suggest confidence in the economy and corporate health. This indicator often move with the business cycle and can act as a leading signal of recession or recovery. Investors and policymakers use it to assess market stress, risk appetite, and monetary policy impact.\nHistorically, a spread above ~2.5% has often preceded recessions, while a spread below ~1.5 suggest economic strength.\nFixed-income investors use the spread to gauge relative value between corporate and government bonds. a high spread may signal undervalued corporate bonds(if default risk is overestimated), and a low spread may indicate overvaluation or excessive risk-taking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Yahoo finance, FRED",

In such cycles, highly leveraged companies often file for bankruptcy, which is important to monitor due to increased volatility. The perception of high interest rates and monetary tightening makes it difficult to pass costs on to consumers, prompting businesses to adjust their operations in pursuit of greater efficiency. Other observed behaviors include:\n\nThere has been a temporary rise in unemployment rates, though without any sudden shifts. Job losses are beginning to occur primarily among workers with lower levels of skills, education, and income-generating capacity. These indicators are being closely monitored by Federal Reserve officials, and signs of concern can be seen in Chairman Powell’s recent statements.\nCompanies are making decisions to reduce costs of goods sold(COGS) and operating expenses(SG&A).\nTemporary increase in the cost of capital for private debt.\nReorganization of supply chains.\n\n\n\nAgroindustry\nLast update: January, 2025\n\n2023 was an incredible year for agriculture, with high productivity for wheat and corn. In 2024, the harvest is a little late(e.g South Dakota area). There was high intensity of rainfall at the beginning of planting with mild temperatutes, causing the crop not to develop as much as in 2023. During the wheat harvest, usually in August, the corn needs more rain to fill the grain, but this year there was not so much during this period.\nThe distortions generated during the pandemic is make 2024 a year of adjusments that are being faced by growers, agricultural auto manufacturing, and machinery and equipment sales, temporarily affeting jobs.\nLooking for agricultural prices, they are still not good. The expectation is not for a bad year, but it will not be as good as 2023. Sales of new equipment have fallen, making it necessary to adjust costs and expenses in companies such as John Deer and CNH industrial.\n\n\n\nAutomotive\nLast update: January, 2025\n\nThe automotive industry faces many challenges in 2024. Slowing growth, increased competition, supply chain disruptions generated during the pandemic and business decisions caused distortions in costs and prices that grew way above the population’s income and general inflation rates. This process may take a few years to stabilize.\nThe volume of new car sales does not follow the same trend as population growth. It requires a deeper analysis to identify cause-and-effect relationships, but for now, the hypotheses raised are accessibility and the durability of the vehicles acording to Autoline Network (2024).\n\nFrom a price perspective, historically, it takes 25 weeks of average household income to buy a new vehicle. The average household income in 2024 is $75.000 ($1.400 per week) which would be enough to buy a vehicle worth $36.000 dollars.\nThe age of the vehicles on the road in the United States is 12.6 years acording to Parekh and Campau (2024)\nThe average cost of car ownership in 2024 was around $12,000 annually according to BLS (vehicle purchase 46%, fuels 22%, finance charges 3%, repairs 8%, insurance 15%, others 6%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancial data from auto industry in the second quarter of 2024.\n\n\n\n\nAuto sales by brand 2Q24\n\n\n\nReducing costs and prices, increasing household income, and finding more sources of revenue such as subscription services are some options that can be observed in the market.\nSome car manufacturers are discovering and applying new materials that that awaken the perception of confort and refinement in consumers and this has been reflected in their choices.\n\n\n\nTransportation\nLast update: September, 2025.\nBetween 2020 and 2023, there was overcapacity in the carrier population due to fluctuating demand, wich remais inconsistent and is currently undergoing adjustments. Despite this, capacity level are still high relative to shipment volumes, putting pressure on logistics providers to streamline operations and pursue efficiency gains. Some carriers are downsizing and reducing freet sies to adapt. On the other hand, the total number of carriers declined by 33,200 between December 2022 and October 2024.\n\nDiesel prices are $3.69 per gallon in September 2025, -3.3% compare with $3.81 per gallon in 2019.\nDry van rates in the spot market are currently $1.89 per mile, down 2.9%, YoY and 14.6% compared to six years ago($2.21 in 2019).\nReefer rates in the spot market are currently $2.42 per mile down 3.7% YoY and 4.2% over six years($2.53 in 2019).\nFlat bed rates in the spot market are currently $2.27 per mile down 4.7% YoY and 9.8% over six years($2.52 in 2019).\n\n\n\nTechnology\nLast update: September, 2025\n\nIn 2025 investments in disruptive technologies continue to show accelerated growth. The highlight has been in data center, generative AI for the cloud, personal computers, smartphone devices, and factory floor which is unlocking possibilities for innovation between interconnected processes such as robotics, augmented reality, and autonomous vehicles.\nFactors such as macroeconomic, geopolitical environment, and intense competition influence the adoption of technology as alternatives to improve operational efficiency in business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe innovation process has accelerated, driven by the development of large generative AI models, known as foundation models. These foundation models are then utilized by specialized applications that build upon them to perform more specific tasks. Finally, traditional processes are leveraging the applications to achieve efficiency gains, create new processes, and develop new value-added products.\n\nInfraestructure\n\nComputing: xAI(Memphis, TN Phase1 concluded, 2nd in 2026), Amazon (Madison County, MS:2027), Google(Mesa, AZ, Lincoln, NE), Microsoft(Mount Pleasant, WI:2025),Meta(Jeffersonville, IN) Nvidia, (OpenAi, Oracle, Softbank, Abilene TX:2030)\nAI foundation models: OpenAI(Msft), Anthropic(Google/Amazon), Cohere(Nvidia), Grok-3(xAi),Gemini-2(Google), DeepSeek-R1(DeepSeek)\nAI Software Service: Palantir\nSynthetic data: Hazy(Microsoft), Sogeti, Epistemix, Mostly AI, Facteus, Sythesis AI, Datavant, Statice, TonicAI, SBX Robotics.\nData Annotation: Scale AI, Appen, Openxcell, SuperAnnotate, iMerit, Labelbox, Cogitobox, CloudFactory, Hive\n\nHorizontal AI\nHorizontal AI refers to AI systems that have a broad range of capabilities and can be applied across multiple industries, domais, or tasks.

On the other hand, in 2021 and 2022 home prices rose 16.7% and 13%, respectively, way above the personal income and this factor may change the effect of this year season. With builders facing challenges in passing on costs to consumers, improving proceses can be a relevant factor in avoiding or minimizing the effects on margins.\nThe plot below shows the behaviors from the perspective of supply and demand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2025 home buyers are looking for better prices and interest rates, two family homes with smarter technologies and other factors that may be relevant such as a gyms, ceilling fans, energy star rated windows, patio, hardwood floors in the living areas, and side-by-side kitchen sink, and close to fun and public transportation.\nOne modality that has been gaining traction is built-to-rent commnunities driving for some factors:\n\nAffordability constraints: Rising home prices and higher mortgage rates have priced many out of homeownership.\nDesire for flexibility and amenities: Renters increasingly seek convenient, maintenance-coworking facilities.\nDemographics: Millenials, GenZ, and retirees are opting for rental lifestyles.\nChanging household dynamics: The growing number of single-person households. The share of people living alone increased every decade from 1940 to 2020 according to Bureau (2023). In 2020 the proportion was 27.6% compared to 26.7% in 2010.\n\nSome indicators that may be evaluated during the next three months are:\n\nMortgage rates, increasing inventories, listing price, time homes are on market.\nNet new home orders that represent the number of new sales contracts that have been finalized and signed by buyers minus customer home order cancellations booked.\nCompanies financial guidance such as Lennar, Toll Brothers, D.R.

    "text": "Lean Principles\n\nThe basic idea of Lean principles is to focus on the customer value that requires a smooth flow in production and elimination of waste during the value-adding process. The quality is built into every step (e.g design, engineering, production, shipping) making it more adaptable to changing environment, and improvement is driven by workers. One example of value is how much the customer is willing to pay for something.\nValue-added activity: transforms or shape materials, and the customer wants it\nNon-value added activity necessary waste: No value is created, but cannot be eliminated based on current technology, policy or thinking for example regulatory procedures, inspections, invoices etc.\nNon-value added activity pure waste: No value is created and consumes resources for example inventory, rework, excess steps and checks, accidents, scraps, waiting times.\n\n\nTypes of WasteGenchi Genbutsu5SBasic Stability1Basic Stability2Basic Stability3Value StreamMudaTraining1Training2\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of waste\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example of Gemba Walk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example of Five S\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Stability Flow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Variability Flow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Control Flow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example of Value Stream Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example of Waste(Muda)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEbbinghaus forgetting curve\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example of Spaced Learning Curve\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nArtificial Intelligence encompasses a powerful set of general-purpose tools. These include machine learning models used for prediction and recomendation, large language models that support knowledge dissemination and tasks automation, computer vision systems that enable the capture, processing, and control of manufacturing operactions, digital twins that simulate virtual environments using real-time data, and autonomous agents capable of performing tasks in produtions settings.\nTo make these technologies work effectively, several key components are required such as labeled and synthetic data, sensors, variation control, optimization techniques, engineering, design, and many other elements developed by humans.\nSince our focus is on manufacturing, we continue with the following questions:\n\nHow can AI tools(e.g., predictive, generative, and agent-based models) support the implementation of a lean culture in business?\nHow can Lean principles, the PDCA method, and quality tools be integrated into an AI agent to effectively solve manufacturing problems?\n\n\n\nAn example of te retrieval-agumented generation(RAG) approach, which leverages a knowledge base as contextual input to enhance the performance of large language models(LLMs).\n\n\n\n\n\nPDCA\n\nThe basic idea of PDCA method is create a universal language to serve as a guide for thinking during the problem-solving process. If language is the vehicle of thought Wittgenstein and Monk (2022), PDCA is a way to make that vehicle faster.\nThe basic idea of the quality tools is reduce waste during performing a value-added task or process, for example time, effort, unnecessary movement etc.\n\n\n\nPDCA (Plan-do-check-action) Method\n\n\n\n\n\nData Science\n\nData science is the practice of solving real-world problems using data to create meaningful impact for a business or system. This impact can take the form of insights, data products, or actionable recommendations. To achieve this, data scientists rely on tools such as machine learning models, data visualizations, technical reports, dashboards, and more.\nThe principles of data science involve breaking down complex problems into fundamental truths, collecting data from diverse sources, and identifying and correctiong errors and inconsistencies to ensure data quality. Data is then analyzed(visually and statistically) to uncover patters and insights. This process includes transforming and selecting variables, and applying techniques such as statistics, programming, and machine learning to build various types of models:\n\nDescriptive models, which help illustrate and summarize the characteristics of the data.\nInferential models, which support decision-making by answering research questions or testing specific hypotheses.\nPredictive models, which aim to generate the most accurate forecasts possible for new or unseen data Kuhn and Silge (2022).\n\nAmong the foundations of data science, two stand out as fundamental:\n\nScientific, which would basically be asking “why” and demanding a rational answer to que question. It requires abilities such as ask insightful questions, active listening, strong orgazational skills, and effective communication of complex ideas in simple terms. As data science often involves sensitive information, understanding ethical considerations and data privacy is critical. This ensures that data is used responsibly and in compliance with regulations.\nTechnical, which would basically the application of technical or scientific knowledge or both to something with a practical purpose. it requires abilities in statistics and probability such as data distributions and statistical tests, programming like Python and R, ability to represent data visually for communicating findings, and machine learning that involves training models to make predictions or decisions based on data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for more detail about Impact of data science in manufacturing\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, advanced sensors, IoT devices, and AI-driven analytics enable real-time monitoring of production lines, predictive maintenance, and quality control. Machine learing algorithms help in identifying patterns and anomalies, leading to proactive decision-making.\nLooking forward, autonomous decision-making, adaptive manufacturing systems, and personalized production will coexist. Data integration across supply chains and the adoption of digital twins will enable virtual simulations for testing and optimization before physical production begins. Use of cyber-physical systems will reduce the boundaries between the physical and digital, with smart-manufacturings capable of self-otimization, atomic-level vision capability and real-time response to market demand. Some examples os pratical application os data science on manufacturing including:\n\nPredictive Analysis: To monitor businesss operations, performance, and potential solutions to problems impeding future prospects. Machine learning and deep learning are used to predict energy consumption, mechanical properties, and other performance metrics.\nMaintenace: Predict equipment failures, enabling manufacturers to take proactive measures to avoid or mitigate them. By leveraging predictive analytics techniques, manufaturers can identify potential issues before they occur, reducing downtime and increasing overall efficiency. Traditional time-based preventative maintenance strategies can be augmented with data-driven insights, allowing for more informed decision-making and optimized maintenance planning. With careful planning and analysis, equipment manufacturers can schedule maintenance breaks or shutdowns to address potential problems, minimizing delays and failures. This proactive approach helps ensure equipment reliability, reduces maintenance costs and optimizes production output.\nPrice reduction: To optimize their pricing strategies, leading to significant cost reductions. When setting product prices, manufaturers must consider a multitude of factors, including raw material costs, manufacturing expenses, distribution fees, maintenance costs, and more. To strike the perfect balance between profitability and customer affordability, manufacturers leverage price optimization techniques. By analyzing pricing and cost data from both internal and external sources, data science anables manufaturers to gain a competitive edge and develop optimized price variants. This data-driven approach allows manufacturers to identify areas of inefficiency, minimize costs, and maximize revenue, ultimately leading to increased profitability and a stronger market presence. Manufacturers can make informed pricing decisions that drive business growth, improve profitability, ad enhance customer satisfaction.\nDirecting the Supply Chain: Data science could help manufaturers to navigate risks and uncertainties, providing visibility with the agility they need to respond quickly to changing market conditions and customer needs. Proactively identify potential disruptions, asses their likelihood, and develop strategies to mitigate their impact. Supply chain management requires a deep understanding of the complex variables, including supplier performance, inventory levels, transportation costs, and customer demand. Some examples where data science can be helpful in the supply chain are shown below.\nWarranty Analysis: To optimize warranty claims process by analizing data from various sources, including product performance, customer feedback, and warranty claims, manufaturers can identify early warning signs for product failures and take proactive measures to address them. Data scientists can help manufacturers analyze the root causes of product defects, identify patterns and trends, and develop predictive models to forecast potential warranty claims. With the help of AI and warranty analytics, manufacturers can process vast amounts of warranty-related data from multiple sources, including:\nProduct Authenticity: Product authenticity is particularly important in the pharmaceutical and food industries, where counterfeit or adulterated products can have serious consequences for public health. Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) is a powerfil analytical technique to help manufacturers to ensuring the authenticity of products across various industries. With the unique spectral signatures of materials, NIRS enables the rapid and non-invasive identification of chemical composition, allowing manufacturers to verify the ahthenticity of their products. The system operates by emitting infrared photons from the light source, which interact with the sample, causing molecular vibrations or stretching within the sample. These interactions result in a spectrum that reflects the properties of the molecules and thei chemical bonds. To extract meaningful information, the spectra undergo specific preprocessing (e.g. PLS,PCA) techniques to eliminate noise and redundat data. Subsequently, these techniques are employed to identify effective wavelengths that precisely classify the product.A well-constructed model can accurately classify the product with minimal error.\nRobotization and Automation: To perform repetitive, mundane, and hazardous tasks, freeing up human workers to focus on higher-value activities. However, the integration and maintenance of robots can be a significant annual expense for manufaturers. This where data science comes in - by analyzing data from various sources(Exploring more in this topic in the future), manufacturers can optimize robot programming and operation, leading to improved product quality and reduced costs. Some examples of the pratical application of data science in robotis and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nKuhn, Max, and Julia Silge. 2022.

    "section": "The Past",
    "text": "The Past\nExploring past experiences stimulates our capacity for mental time travel, which is essential for survival and adaptation. It helps us predict outcomes, learn from mistakes, and develop a sense of identity. Studying the past also reveals how experiences shape history and influence memory formation and learning.\nProcess Innovation History\n\nShortening the Distance: Improving the movement of goods to stimulate trade, industry, agriculture, and communication both regionally and nationwide. The Erie Canal(a navigable waterway completed in 1825), connected the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean, according to DPLA (1821). Its primary goal was to develop and agricultural expansion. This transformation significantly impacted the marginal product of labor, as noted by Kaiman, Vandenbroucke, and Wolla (2024). Beyond its economic effects, the canal had profound societal impacts, shaping the nation’s development throughout the 19th century:\n\nIt spurred westward migration and enhanced commercial trade between regions.\n\nIt contributed to the emergence of new towns along its route.\n\nIt fostered cultural and political unity between the Northeast and the expanding Western territories.\n\n\n\n\nErie Canal MapErie Canal ImpactsErie Canal Engineering\n\n\n\n\n\nErie Canal Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy 1855 cross-state travel went from six weeks to six days, and freight costs fell from $100 to $5 per ton - Old Newarks’ Main Street Bridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNathan Roberts’ illustration of a stump puller-using wheels, ropes, and horse power to extract tree stumps-boosted daily stump removal tenfold, from 4 to 40. These innovations earned the group the nickname ‘Erie School of Engineers’”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Processes: Creating better products, faster and more affordably. The Bessemer process patented by Henry Bessemer in 1855 in the U.S. and popularized in the 1870s by visionary entrepreneur Andrew Carnegie. This innovation enabled the construction of transformative infrastructure such as bridges, ships, trains, elevators, oil and water pipelins, and vertical buildings. The process dramatically reduced the manufacturing time of single steel rail from two weeks to just fifteen minutes.\nKnowledge Base, Science, and Data: During the rise of the oil industry in the late 19th century, improvements in efficiency within the petroleum refining process were crucial to gaining a competitive edge. These advancements were achieved through the application of scientific methods, the establishment of strategic commercial partnerships. and the implementation of product standardization and operational uniformity. Together, these innovations not only streamlined production and reduced costs but also reinforced John D. Rockefeller’s natural leadership capabilities, enabling him to build a highly organized and dominant enterprise in the energy sector.\nRedefine Customer Values: Companies like Ford, Home Depot, Nike, Dell, Apple, Netflix, and Tesla exemplify how redefining customer value can unlock entirely new demand. Rather than competing solely on price or features, these companies intruduced experiences and solutions that consumers didn’t even know they needed and tranforming industries in the process. By building powerful, cohesive business systems designed to consistently deliver this new value, they outperformed competitors who were still focused on traditional efferings. As a result, the elevated customer expectations to levels that others struggle to meet, creating a lasting competitive adavantage rooted in innovation and custmer centric thinking.\nImportance of competition: There is a potential link bewteen consistently low levels of stress and anxiety(especially when individuals or organizations remain in their confort zones), and a decline in economic competitiveness. While operating within a confort zone can support mental and physical well-being, it may also foster complacency and resistance to change. In contrast, moderate stressors(**such as the presence of strong competitors or the pressure of market competition*), can stimulate problem-solving, innovation, and the adoption of new technologies. Theses challenges push individuals and organizations to adapt, evolve, and improve. Over time, a lack of competitive pressure and growth opportunities can lead to reduced motivation, diminished creativity, and stagnation. Stress, when managed effectively, acts as a catalyst for cognitive adaptation, which is essential for maintaining productivity and relevance in dynamic economic environments. Historical patterns of this bahavior were evident in the United States during 1980s, as documented by sources such as JustARandomChannel (2019), Peter Santenello (2024), and FRONTLINE PBS (2024), and similar trends are observable in Germany in 2024, as reported by DW News (2024). These examples highlight how the absence of meaningful competition can erode a nation’s or organization’s innovative edge.\nProcess Improvement: Founded in 1906 by Willian Riley, New Balance is an American footwear and apparel company headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts. It is recognized as one of the world’s leading manufacturers of high-quality athletic footwear. Known for its “Made in USA” products, the company emphasizes innovation and performance, applying lean principles and tools to enhance product flow from its manufacturing plants to retailers and end customers.\nNew Balance began its lean transformation journey in 2003 with guidance from the Toyota Supplier Support Center. The company focused on problem-solving and process improvement to foster a culture of employee engagment while boosting operational performance.\nLean is both a management philosophy and a set of practices aimed at creating more value for customers with less waste. It emphasizes continuous process improvement and the elimination of non-value-adding activities. A deep understanding of the value creation process, ongoing learning through PDCA(Plan-Do-Check-Action) cycles, and a willingness to challenge assumptions are essential for both workers and managers. These principles not only improve efficiency but also strengthen competitiveness in a fast-changing global market.\n\nProblem-Solving Culture A strong problem-solving culture empowers employees to actively identify and address issues rather than waiting for top-down directives. In such environments, regular team meetings are help not just to report problems, but to collaboratively explore solutions and implement improvements. Leaders shift from giving orders(e.g., Do this, do that) to facilitating ownership by saying, “Here’s the problem, here’s the gap we’re trying to close. What do you think we should do? How can I support you?”\nLean Education Associates receive structured training on lean principles, including hands-on workshops focused on waste detection and process improvement. Lean education shifts the mindset from “the manager solves problem” to “the coach develops problem-solvers.” This approach builds critical thinking, encourages ownership, and fosters an culture of continuous improvement. By learning to identify inefficiencies and propose solutions, employees become active contributors to organizational excellence. Lean thinking becomes not just a skill but a shared language for innovation and growth.\nContinuous improvement Employees are encouraged to submit improvement ideas, with recognition and rewards given for successful implementations. Lean enterprises must grow not only to increase value creation but also to provide meaningful opportunities for theirs employees. By continuously improving and becoming more efficient, they can stay competitive and help secure long-term job stability for their workforce Murman (2008)",

    "text": "The Present\nFocusing on the present helps us understand how we process information in real time, which is essential for responding quickly to stimuli and peforming daily activities with mindfulness. One of the main challenges in staying present is managing the overwhelming amount of digital and physical distractions the constantly compete for our attention.\nChallenges\n\nDisruptive technologies emerge when new ideas(or even old ones) are reimagined through integration with advanced tools like generative AI, atomic-level computer vision, and exponential computational power. These innovations challenge traditional models, unlockingcapabilities that were previously unimaginable. Embracing them is key to staying ahead in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.\n\nDemographic shifts around the world: Populations are becoming older and increasingly urbanized. Below is an example of the demographic transition occuring in several countries.\n\nP Pencentage of the population in each group\nT Total population (in million) in each group\nAS Number of adults per senior (aged 65 and older)\nAY Number of adults per Young (aged 0-19)\n\n\n\n\nIndiaChinaIndonesiaUnited StatesBrazilJapanGermany\n\n\n\n\n\nDemographic transition - India\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemographic transition - China\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemographic transition - Indonesia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemographic transition - USA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemographic transition - Brazil\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemographic transition - Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemographic transition - Germany\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEconomic activities in emerging markets: Many countries are emerging from poverty, creating both opportunities and challenges(e.g. rising number consumer demand and increased competition due to lower labor costs).\n\n\n\n\n\nPCA (Principal Component Analysis) applied to cross-country data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to learn more about the chart\n\n\n\n\n\nExplanation of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Graph of the Country Power Index\nThis graph you’re looking at is a “map” that helps us understand how different countries position themselves in relation to their “power” and what factors contribute to that power, for both 2022 and 2024. Think of it as a way to simplify a large amount of complex data into an easy-to-interpret image.\nWhat are we seeing here?\n\nThe Points (Countries): Each teal/green point represents a country in a specific year (e.g., “USA_22” is the USA in 2022, “China_24” is China in 2024). The closer these points are to each other, the more similar the countries are in their power profiles. Countries that are far apart are quite different.\nThe Arrows (Power Factors): The red arrows represent the “eight measures of power” that were measured for each country (such as “military_strength,” “econ_output,” “education,” “rule_of_law,” etc.). The blue arrow (“score”) represents the total “Empire score.”\nThe Axes (Dimensions): The horizontal (Dim1) and vertical (Dim2) axes are the primary “dimensions” that the PCA found to summarize all your data. Together, they explain 46.3% + 18.8% = 65.1% of the total variation in the data. This means these two axes capture most of the relevant information about country power.\n\nHow to interpret the map:\n\nDirection of the Arrows:\n\nArrows pointing in the same direction indicate that these factors are correlated – meaning they tend to increase or decrease together. For example, “military_strength,” “econ_output,” “infraestru_investmt,” and “trade” all point in the same (upper-right) direction, suggesting that countries strong in one of these aspects tend to be strong in the others as well.\nArrows pointing in opposite directions suggest a negative correlation. There aren’t strong examples here of directly opposing factors, which is good, as all contribute to some kind of “power.”\nThe length of the arrow is important: longer arrows indicate that the factor has a greater influence on how countries are positioned on the map.\n\nPositioning of Countries relative to the Arrows:\n\nA country positioned in the same direction as an arrow (and far from the center) is strongly characterized by that factor. For example:\n\nUSA (USA_22, USA_24) and China (China_22, China_24): They are clearly positioned in the upper-right quadrant, in the direction of factors like “military_strength,” “econ_output,” “trade,” “innov_tech,” “education,” and “infraestru_investmt.” This means these two countries are the strongest in these dimensions, which are the main drivers of the overall power “score.” They are dominating what we might call “traditional economic and military power.” The USA is positioned slightly further to the right, perhaps indicating a slightly greater strength in these aspects on average than China, but both are dominant powers.\nNordic/European Countries (Netherland_24, France_24, Germany_22, UK_24): They tend to be in the lower quadrant, more aligned with “rule_of_law” and, to some extent, “acts_of_nature” (which could be a measure of resilience or geographic/environmental stability, or perhaps a residual measure in the model). This suggests these countries excel in governance and stability, but perhaps with less emphasis on “military_strength” compared to the USA/China.\nIndia (India_24) and Russia (Russ_24): Appear in the upper-left quadrant, associated with “geology” and “charac_civility_determ” (likely intrinsic or cultural characteristics influencing power, or perhaps natural resources and resilience in the case of “geology”). “India_24” also points towards “cost_compet” (cost competitiveness). This shows that their power profiles are different from the dominant powers, perhaps with more emphasis on natural resources or cultural aspects, and less alignment with the factors in the right quadrant.\n\n\nMovement of Countries Over Time (2022 vs. 2024):\n\nYou can observe how a country’s position changes from 2022 to 2024. For example, China and the USA show slight movement but maintain their dominant positions.\nSome countries might move more significantly, indicating shifts in their power profiles within just two years. For example, Turkey_22 and Turkey_24 show a slight improvement along the Dim1 axis, indicating an increase in the factors on the right side.\n\n\nBusiness Implications:\n\nIdentification of Competitors and Opportunities: This map allows for quick identification of the main “players” (USA, China) and an understanding of the pillars of their power. For businesses, this can pinpoint where the greatest market opportunities, innovation hubs, or geopolitical risks lie.\nComparative Advantage Analysis: Helps understand the comparative advantages of different regions. If you are looking for markets with strong rule of law and stability, the lower quadrant might be more relevant. If you are seeking markets driven by high economic output and innovation, the upper-right quadrant is the focus.\nLocation and Investment Strategies: Companies can use this type of analysis to decide where to invest, considering the power factors most important to their objectives (e.g., access to skilled labor via “education,” developed infrastructure via “infraestru_investmt”).\nRisk Assessment: Countries that move erratically on the map, or that are associated with less stable power factors, might represent higher risks or emerging opportunities.\nUnderstanding Trends: By comparing 2022 and 2024, we can infer global trends. If most countries are moving to the right, it might indicate a growing importance of factors associated with Dim1 (economic output, military, etc.).\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate change: New rules aimed at protecting the environment, enhancing our ability to adapt to and interact with it through the development of innovative products and services.\n\n\n\n\n\nElectricity consumption by country\n\n\n\nErosion fo U.S. industrial capacity: Over the past few decades, the U.S. has experienced a significant decline in its industrial capacity. In 1980, the U.S. manufactured over 40 percent of global high-technology goods, facing 18 percent today. This decline poses a threat to both economic competitiveness and national security.\n\nPRC’s Dominance: China has emerged as a potential competitor, cultivation substantial high-tech industrial production capacity and accounting for nearly 30 percent of global manufacturing output. China has strategically prioritized advanced manufacturing as a cornestone of its national rejuvenation strategy.\n\nSkills Gap and Workforce Shortages: Outsourcing production has led to a skills gap in the U.S. workforce. This is compounded by a persistent labor shortage in the manufacturing sector, with a projected shortfall of 2.1 million unfilled jobs by 2030. This shortage hinders the adoption and implementation of advanced manufacturing technologies.\n\nSmall and Medium Manufacturing Adoption Barriers: Small and medium-sized manufacturers contribute the majority of the U.S. manufacturing ecosystem and they face significant obstacles in adopting advanced manufacturing technologies. These include a lacka of access to capital, expertise, and resources for system upgrades and integration.\n\nUnderinvestment in R&D: The U.S. lags behind other advanced economies in manufacturing-related R&D spending as a percentage of GDP. This underinvestment hinders innovation and the development of cutting-edge manufacturing technologies. Key actors(industry, universities, and governments) need to work together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpportunities\n\nReconceptualize the workforce: The changing nature of manufacturing requires a new approach to workforce development, with a focus on training “technologists” skilled in both engineering and operation of advanced machinery.\n\nLeverage existing programs: The United States can build upon succesful programs like the manufacturing USA program and the Manufacturing Externsion Partnetship(MEP) to accelerate workforce development initiatives.\nFocus on cyber skills: The increasing integration of digital technologies in manufacturing requires a workforce with strong cyber skills.\nDevelop a national talent marketplace: A centralized platform connecting job seekers with advanced manufacturing opportunities can help to adress workforce shortages.\nLeveraging U.S. Strenths in AI and Software: The U.S. enjoys a significant lead in generative AI, a technology with the potential to transform various facets of advanced manufacturing (e.g.GenAI can creates copilots to helps workers interpret complex factory data and enhance AI-driven design tools that can create product designs from natural language descriptions)\nRebuilding Domestic Production Capacity:\nPublic and Private Investments:\nCollaboration with Allies and Partners:\nReshoring and Scaling Up Production:\n\nIndustrial Policy for Process Innovation and Recent Development in U.S.\n\nCHIPS Act: The U.S.manufacturing share of GDP down 16% since 2012, share of semiconductor production declined from 37% in 1990 to 12% in 2022, and produced no cutting-edge advanced chips. Also, $205B trade deficit in advanced tech products, and the Hamilton Index R. D. Atkinson (2022) showing gaps with comparison to another countries. To reduce theses gaps, U.S. Congress passed Chips Act to incentivize U.S. and allied country firms to build or expand advanced-industry R&D and production sites in the United States. The focus on quantum computing, robotics, 6G equipments, gene edititing, high bandwidth memory chips, chipmaking equipment and software to develop advanced AI systems to improve manufacturing capabilities. Not only invent in U.S. but manufacture in U.S.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScience: The basic idea was to identify 10 strategic tecnologies like quantum autonomous systems, AI, biotech, etc. and then give funding to National Science Fundation but for slightly later TRL research more focus on commercialization and partnership with industry.\nRegional Innovation Hubs: Program that recognized that almost all of the really advanced innovation and job growth was in five methopolitan areas in the U.S. (Silicon Valleym, Boston, Seattle) and that there was this big regional gap in the heartland if you will so this\nRelated Manufacturing: The manufacturing extension partnership at the National Institute of Standards and Technology it’s basically extension services for SMMs(Small and medium-sized manufacturers).\nIRA(Inflation reduction Act): During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the U.S. has experienced 40-year record-high inflation that has just now started to cool down over the past serveral months. Inflation Reduction Act was sined into law in 2022. Key provisions of the bill are directly aimed at improving the lives of the American middle class and easing financial burdens in a post-pandemic economy. This includes up to $600 per year toward energy-efficient skylights, and up to $500 per year for two doors.\n\nEstablish an economic initiative commiting the U.S. to increase its relative level of advanced-industry concentration by 20% poonts in a decade.\nAccording to Atkinson (2024) , Assuming a 3% growth rate in the rest of the economy, doing so could add nearly $2.5T to advanced-industry output over 10 years. It would also reduce U.S. supply chain vulnerability, create millions of good jobs, could adjust imbalances in home prices, reduce trade deficit, waken China’s advanced economy, and shore up dual-use industries critical to U.S. National Defense.\nAccording to Bonvillian (2024) , different approaches were applied such as top down, bottom up, direct production support, demonstration projects, supply chain support, and regional implementation. The impact can be seen in the chart below (Overall U.S. Manufacturing construction), and also in the growth of investment in machinery and equipment(by brekdown of GDP).",

    "text": "The Future\nStudying the future to understand decision-making processes, planning, and expectation building, which are crucial for strategic goals. Anticipating future scenarios helps analyze consequences and risks, leading to more effective and safer decisions. The challenges is to control anxiety especially in very optimistic or pessimistic projections.\nProcess Innovation of the future\n\nShorten the distance Improving the flow of traded goods transforming trade, industry, agriculture, and communication in the region and across the country.\n\nReturning supersonic trips more affordable for passengers, profitable for companies, cleaner, quieter, and dramatically more fuel efficient. Speed of sound making the world feel smaller for example Tokio-Seattle in 4.4 hours, New York to London in 3.4 hours. The overture synphony engine runs with a 100% sustainable aviation fuel making supersonic flights more efficient than subsonic flights in terms of carbon emissions.\nSatelite high speed internet communication More information, education,\nHyperloop is a technology has the potential to offering faster, more efficient, and sustainable logistics solutions. It can transport cargo at speeds of up to 700 mph, significantly reducing travel times, reducing downtime and incresing overall efficiency. some ot the challenges of this technology today are maintaining a vaccum seal in the tubes, propulsion, and levitation systems. Despite thise challenges, several companies, including HyperloopTT, Hardt B.V., and Transpod, are actively working on developing hyperloop technology for cargo transportation.\n\nNew processes: Making better products, faster and cheaper. (Innovation economic book here, tesla unbox here, example based tactile simulation and sim-to-real applications )\n\nBattery manufacturing process Advancing dry-process battery technology that enable to dry print anodes and varios cathodes(e.g lithium iron phospate-LFP, nickel manganese cobalt-NMC, sodium ion etc) with no metal or liquid inside it, saving weight(23% from today standards), space in the packaging, costs(7% from today standards), more easely to recycling, more safe because no risk of thermal runaway, and 30% more energy density(from today standards 272 Wh/kg).\n\n\n\nSakuú revolutionary dry-electrode printing technology enables more advanced and sustainable battery manufacturing at scale, including elimination of toxic materials and solvents, reduction in cost complexity, and ability to work with a very range of both current and future active materials and battery chemistries. It’s enable battery producers and original equipment manufacturer(OEMs) to successfully meet this incredible surge in demand and do it more sustainably. That’s why we are the world’s first manufacturing platfform for printing battery electrodes?\n\n\n— Mr. Robert Bagheri, founder and CEO of Sakuú\n\n\nModular Assembly or Unboxed Manufacturing Process A modular approach where vehicle sub-assenblies are manufactured independently and connected later. Giga Castings, replacing hundreds of smaller parts with large, single-piece castings simplifies assembly, reduces weight, and improves structural rigidity. Autonomous Production eliminating traditional conveyor belts and exploring autonomous vehicles that move through production areas. Flow chart would go from a linear process flow to a parallel process flow. 30% increase in assembly speed and a 44% increase in worker density requiring a smaller factory, 40% smaller factory footprint leading to lower capital expenditure and 50% reduction in cost of good sold for future vehicles.\nKnowledge base, science, and data: (insert Lip-Bu Tan here, What are the limitation of scientists today?What are your questions? Insert the schematic process of the beagle sensors and processing here )\n\nChip manufacturing there a five generations waves happening at the same time including AI Machine learning, Industry 4.0, Autonomous driving, and cloud computing.\nData analysis U.S. have in BLS website which has 400 digitis nakes codes manufacturing sectors with every year like productivity growth, amount of labor, labor cost, capital investment. For example use this data to correlate wage levels to capex. Does Capex correlate to lagged productivity? What sectors doing the most? Today don’t also have any analysis of the causes for example why is our car production sector so weak?\nSmart grids Planning of alternatives, When increasing of distributed generation(pch, biomass, pv, nuclear, hydro, coal, o&g, vehicles) that requires a network that absorbs, knows and receives this data and reacts positively at the same time thatt is has to give a return to those who are offering energy and to those who are investing. Concepts of automation, data science, great possibilities of energy transactions.\nThe ability of EVs to both draw electricity from the grid for charging and supply electricity back to the grid through vehicle-to-grid(V2g) technology has a significant implications for the smart grid system. An example of a practical application of the system would be when a blizzard is forecast. Wheather forecast systems communicate with vehicles requestion maximum battery charging before the storm. This charge could be used during a period of power outages.\n\nReal world example: Denmark’s Edison Project with V2G feasibility with 10 bi-directional EVs, Californica V2G Pilot tested this technology with 50 EVs, Japan’s Chademo Association developed V2G-capable charging standards. Future outlook is increase adoption, advanced technologies(improvements in battery tech, power electronics and cybersecurity), and grid integration(decentralized renewable energy-based smart grid).\nNuclear Fusion Bring electricity to low income countries bringing significant improvement in standard of living.\nSmart cars Communication between them and the system reducing accidents and casualties, saving millions of dollars and thousands of lives.\nSmart tags Solving the problems of lines in the supermarket.\nHigh speed trains Solving problems of wating times and necessity of security checks in the airports.\nSmart robots machine-knitted pressure-sensitive low cost tactile skin that is scalable\nAutonomous truck John Deer CES 2025, save time, reduce risks os crash through drive assistant. 20 years ago we were probably pushing 120 tons an hour, and today we’re mining 350/370 tons an hour. We run 24/7 we run like on a four shift basis the larg of the corry that there’s many new challenges safy, employment and training finding skilled labor is very challenging it to be able to run and see them as machine and be able operate it from my desk will eliminate the training, eliminate safety factors you want everybody to go home safe it’s going to increse productivity out of the mine and give me more time to be more creative of what we need to do in the future.\n\nExample fully autonomous ADT or Dusty manufacture in Devenport Iowa that machine leverages starts with hihg performance eletronics, designed and tested by John Deere for over 30 years to operate in Earth’s toughest environments the ruggedized component stack includes satellite internet advanced controls, starfire gps, 360 view cameras and sensors, and high performance GPU’s which enable us to deliver real autonomy into the and dirty world of construction.\nTechnical training Hands-on practical experience by using virtual reality and advanced training simulators to prepare the workforce for advanced manufacturing jobs (e.g Palette Skils, Advanced Industry Training by Weber State University)\n\nRedefine customer values: Create new damand by delivering a previously unknown experience to consumers. They built powerful, cohesive business systems that could deliver more of this value than their competitors. They raised customer expectations beyond what their competitors could reach. According to Gary Cohn, increase in GDP growth could substantially reduce debt/GDP ratio, which could consequently improve investors’s long-term planning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess improvement: The best possible products at the lowest possible cost, in the most timely manner, on a stable long-term basis.\n\nIntelligent management grid Electric vehicle charging management according to variables such as demand, time, and avaiability. The vehicle would make the decision based on data analysis with focus on system avaiability.\n\n\n\n[The main problem\nUnderstand how innovation systems work and how to optimize their organization to drive economic growth and solve societal problems.\nAttempt to get inside that unexplained or poorly understood process of innovation, that it’s like a mystery box where you know what goes in(investment, research) and what comes out(new technologies, economic growth), but also understand the internal workings of how it transforms inputs into outputs. Understand how the innovation system is actually organized to optimize the results.\nHistory\n\n1945 to 1973: U.S. productivity growth 2% range.\n1973 to 1993: U.S. productivity growth &lt; 1% range.\n1995 to 2000: U.S. productivity growth 3.5% and economic growth 4.2%\n\nAccording to (bonvillian?) the Jorgenson’s theory shows how the IT wave of the 1990s drove significant economic growth due to rapid technological innovation. This was characterized by a core technology(semiconductors) that became ever more capable at ever lower cost.\nIn modern times, we could observe a similar pattern in the advancement and widespread adoption of renewable energy technologies, and advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies.\n\nCore Technology: AI Algorithms, machine learning models, and the specialized hardware that power them.\nDeclining Cost Base: The cost of processing power and data representation and storage needed for AI development has singificantly decreased over time. This makes AI development and deployment better, faster and cheaper.\nIncreased Capability: AI models are constantly becoming fmore sophisticated, capable of handling complex tasks from natural language processing to image recognition and predictive analytics with increasing accuracy and speed.\nEconomic Impact: This has led to widespread adoption across various industries, from healthcare and finance to manufacturing and entertainment, driving efficiency gains, creating new services, and fostering economic growth in the digital economy.\n\n\n\nAction Plan\n\nSemiconductors: Chips and Science Act, focus on increasing US competitiveness in the semiconductor industry, incentive for creating research and development centers in semiconductor techonologies.\nEnergy Technologies: Inflation Reduction Act, incentives for the production of electric vehicles, batteries electricity, and tax credits for companies investing in clean technologies.\nTechnology Demonstrations: Infraestructure Act, focus on infrastructure projects that promote innovation and sustainability, incentives for the adoption of clean and efficient techonologies in infrastructure project.\n3-3-3 plan: Involve cutting the budget deficit to 3% of GDP by 2028, boosting GDP growth to 3% through deregulation and other pro-growth policies, and increasing U.S. energy production to the equivalent of an additional 3 million barrels of oil per day.\nWorkforce Education:\nAmbitious of industrialize: Build the factories, Supply chain, and vertically integrate those Supply chains together.\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of processes guided by objectives and strategy\n\n\n\n\nChallenges\n\nLearning by doing: When companies or countries cease production something, it becomes difficult to redevelop that capability. This is due to the speciallized process knowledge required to manufacture high-value-added technology products. Here are some examples of historical process innovations and how they illustrate the importance of learning by doing.\n\nThe Watt Process for power generation from steam: James Watt’s improvements to the steam engine in the 18th centry weren’t solely based on theoretical knowledge. He continuously experimented and refined his designs through practical application, gradually increasing the engine’s efficiency and paving the way for the Industrial Revolution.\nThe Bessemer Process for Steel Production: In the 19th century, Henry Bessemer developed a process for mass-producing steel. This involved blowing air tinto molten iron to remove impurities. While the initial concept was based on scientific principles, the actual implementation required extensive trial and error to perfect. The continuous refinement of the Bessemer process through practical experience led to a significant reduction in steel prices, fueling advancements in construction, transportation, and other industries.\nThe Planar Process for Microelectronics: Developed in the late 1950s, the plannar process revolutionized the manufacturing of transistors and integrated circuits. This method involved building layers of semiconductor material on a flat substrate. While the scientific understanding of semiconductor was essential, mastering the intricate steps of the planar process required practical experience and continuous improvement through learning by doing. This innovation enabled the miniaturization fo electronics and paved the way for the digital innovation wave.\nFordism: Pioneered by Henry Ford in the early 20th century, revolutionized manufacturing through mass production, vertical integration, experimentation and innovation (e.g. introduced the moving assembly line, a radical innovation that significantly accelerated production)\n\n\nTheses cases emphasize that the United States must regain its learning by doing advantage in advanced manufacturing to compete effectively in the global technology landscape.\n\n\nValue Chain\nBusiness Model and Cultural transformation\n\nAcording Treacy and Wiersema (1993) to becoming an industry leader requires to choose a value discipline that takes into account its capabilities and culture as well as competitors’s strengths .\nRedefined value, create new experiences and perception of benefit For example the value I got from this new electric vehicle.\nBusiness systems that could deliver more of that value than competitors.\nRaised customers’s expectations beyound the competition’s reach. Today’s customers have an expanded concept of value that includes convenience of purchase, after-sale service, dependability, and so on.\nHow to deliver superior customer value in line with one of the three value disciplines - operational excellence, customer intimacy or product leadership - in a world where populations are getting older Anjos (2024) , more urban, new tehnologies are emerging rapidly, economic activity in emerging markets is expanding rapidly all this without forgetting climate change ?\n\n\nValue Chain agentsCustomer value\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of value chain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of the idea of value discipline\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is relationship between small manufacturing and advanced manufacturing? (pag 24)\nWhat about capital access gaps for small medium manufacturing (pag 26)\nWhat about supply chain system with Allies and Partners (pag31,35)\nWhat about training and talent (pag 36, 37,38, 39) and Earl Murman(MIT) with japanese training stats, Ebbinghaus forgetting curve, Jereme Bruner, Lev Vygotsky, Richard Skemp, Zontan Deans, Jean Piaget, Denis Littly, and Raj Shaunak.",

    "text": "Workforce Education\n\nU.S. Strategy Goals\n\n\n\nU.S. Strategy Goals\n\n\n\nReverse declining U.S. manufacturing productivity by accelerating the adoption of advanced manufacturing technologies To achieve productivity levels comparable to leading industrialized nations, the workforce must be trained in operating, maintaining, and innovating with technologies like AI, robotics, and digital twins. This requires widespread technical education, certification programs, and hands-on training in smart manufacturing systems.\nQuadruple advanced manufacturing technology adoption among small and medium-sized manufacturers by 2030. SMMs often lack the resources to train staff in new technologies. Workforce education must include scalable, affordable training solutions such as online platforms, mobile labs, and regional training hubs to ensure these business can adopt and benefit from ADVM tools.\nEstablish strategic trade partnerships with democratic market economies to pool demand for advanced industrial goods. These partnerships will increase demand for high-quality, export-ready products, requiring a workforce skilled in international standards, quality assurance, and supply chain logistics. Education must include global trade literacy and cross-cultural communication skills.\nIncrease U.S. share of global output in advanced industries by at least 20 percentage poins within a decade. Competing globally in high-tech sectors demands a workforce proficient in STEM field(Science, Technology, Engineering, and mathematics), systems engineering, and digital production. Education systems must align with industry needs, emphasizing innovation, design thinking, and cross-disciplinary collaboration.\nCyber-harden the U.S. industrial base to protect against systemic risk, including from AI-enable attacks. As cyber threats grow, especially in AI-integrated systems, there is critical need for cybersecurity professionals with expertise in industrial control systems. Workforce development must prioritize cyber-physical security training and certifications tailored to manufacturing environments.\nProduce energy equivalent to 3 million barrels of oil per day. Meeting this energy goal likely though renewables, nuclear, and advanced fuels requires a new generation of energy technicians, engineers, and systems operators. Workforce education must expand to include green energy technolgies, environmental systems, and energy policy literacy.\nReduce the budget deficit from 6.5% to 3% of GDP (a $2 trillion reduction). A more productive, higher-skilled workforce can increase tax revenues and reduce reliance on social safety nets. Education investments, particularly in high-return areas like technical training and adult reskilling, are essential to achieving fiscal sustainability.\nAchieve an average 3% GDP growth per year. Sustained economic growth depends on labor productivity and innovation. Workforce education must foster entrepreneurial thinking, digital fluency, and adaptability to ensure workers can contribute to and benefit from a dynamic economy.\n\n\n\nWorkforce-Driven Economic Agenda\nNational strategy are influence industrial sectors and emphasizes the role of workforce development as a central driver of change. This change has significant implications for workforce development, particularly in traditional industries such as automotive, steel, textiles, and electronics.\nThese sectors, once the backbolne of American industry, are now being reimagined through the lens of advanced technolgy and sustainability. As a result, a new model of education and training is not just relevant, it’s essential.\nMany of these legacy industries are undergoing technological modernization, incorporating robotics, the Internet of Things(IoT), and artifical intelligence(AI) into their operations. This transformation demands a workforce that is not only familiar with theses technologies but also capable of leveraging them to drive productivity and innovation. However, there is a growing skills gap between what workers currenly know and what modern manufacturing requires. Traditional vocational training programs often struggle to keep pace with the rapid evolution of technology, making them insufficient for preparing workers for the future.\nAt the same time, demographic shifts are creating additional pressure. As older workers retire, there is an urgent need to attract younger talent to these industries. A modernized, tech-integrated education model can help make these careers more appealing to a new generation. Moreover, strengthening domestic manufacturing is also a matter of national resilience and security. Reducing dependece of foreing supply chains requires a robust, skilled workforce that can support and sustain local production capailities.\nArtifical intelligence can play a transformative role in this educational shift. One of its most powerful contributions is the ability to personalize learning. AI can analyze individual learning styles and skill levels to create customized training programs, making education more effective and engaging. It can also power simulations and virtual training environments that replicate complex industrial settings, allowing workers to train safely and efficiently without needing access to physical equipment.\nBeyond training delivery, AI can help forecast future skill demands based on industry trends, enabling education institutions to proactively design curricula that meet emerging needs. It can also automate the creation and translation of traingin materials, makig educational more accessible to diverse populations.\n\n\nForging the Future\nAs the United States pursues ambitious industrial and economic goals for the coming decade, the need for actionable, context-aware recommendations becomes increasingly urgent. However, achieving these outcomes requires more than policy declarations, it demands a strategic rethinking of how we prepare workers for the evolving demands of twenty-first-century industries.\nW. B. Bonvillian and Sarma (2021) present a compelling case for transforming the fragmented and outdated systems of workforce training in the U.S. They argue that the current model is ill-equipped to meet the pace of technological change and the scale of economic disruption. Their work highlights the importance of rapid, scalable, and inclusive education models such as short-cycle credentialing, modern appreniceships, and the integration of new learning technologies that can equip workers with the skills they need now, not just in the distant future.\nDrawing from this framework, the recommendations that follow are grounded in situational knowledge: they respond to the specific challenges faced by key industrial sectors like manufacturing, healthcare, and retail, and align with the strategic goals outlined for national growth and resilience. These proposals aim to bridge the gap between policy ambition and workforce readiness, offering pathways to empower individuals, strengthen industries, and ensure that technological progress translates into broad-based economic opportunity.\nShort, Intensive Programs in Advanced Manufacturing\nA significant need is anticipated in manufacturing sector, with an estimated two million or more manufacturing jobs opening in the coming decade due to an aging workforce and retirements. The sector requires a lot of upskilling to undertake advanced manufacturing and remain competitive, which means new hires will need higher skills.\nDevelopment of short course (10-20 weeks) as crucial new approach for the workforce, as many cannot take two years off for a degree. These programs should offer credentials that can be built into groups and stacked towards degrees over time.\nUniversities can contribute to developing new advanced curriculum for fields like advanced manufacturing.\n\n\n\n\n\nPutting New Education Technologies to Use\nOnline education as a powerful thing and a game changer especially for scaling up to meet workforce training challenges.\nKey technologies highlighted include augmented reality and virtual reality. Online credentialing is also critical, allowing individuals to earn verified digital credentials for short courses that can be easily shared(e.g linkedIn, Xjobs) and validated by employers without traditional verification calls. The MicroMasters program at MIT is an example of such a credentialing system, offering a pathway to a master’s degree.\nThe rapid pace of change, with new job category like data scientist and Instagram marketing emerging quickly, makes online education crucial for rapid retraining and upskilling. The science of learning principles, such as spaced retrieval (revisiting information over time) and interleaving(alternating topics to detect differences), are also better supported by online platforms.\nFor the future of education technology, Andrej Karpathy at Y Combinator (2025) spoke about the need for two distinct applications. One for teachers and one for students. This concept stems from his broader vision of software 3.0, where large language models and natural language interfaces redefine how we build and interact with software.\nKarpathy argues that the roles of teachers and students are fundamentally different in the learning process, and therefore, their digital tools should reflect that distinction.\n\nFor students, the app should be optimized for exploration, engagement, and personalized learning. It would leverage AI to adapt content to each learner’s pace, style, and interests, offering interactive lessons, real-time feedback, and gamified experiences. The student app becomes a dynamic tutor, capable of guiding learner through complex topics using conversational interfaces and intelligence scaffolding.\nFor teachers, the app would serve as a command center for orchestrating learning experience. It would provide insights into studen progress, highlight areas where learners are struggling, and suggest interventions. Teachers coudl use it to design curricula, assign tasks, and even co-crate content with AI assistance. Importantly, this app would also support professional development, helping educators stay current with pedagogical strategies and technological tools.\n\nKarpathy emphaisizes that separating these apps allows each to be deeply optimized for its user’s needs. Teachers require analytical and administrative capabilities, while students benefit from intuitive, immersive learning environmnet. By building these apps around the strengths of AI with natural langague undestanding, personalization, and automation, education can become more scalabe, inclusive, and effective.\nCollaboration Between Federally Supported Programs\nUnifying effort at the state level, reconnecting Labor Department and Education Department, enabling them to work in tandem and foster collaborative initiatives.\nRobust and transparent labor market information system is essential to underpin an effective workforce education system. The current system leaving workers unsure of necessary skills, educators uncertain of what to teach and employers lacking clear information on available talent. Fixing this information gap is paramout for guiding all participants effectively.\nBroader expanded employer role in workforce education. This includes employers engaging in disigning curriculum to ensure that training programs deliver the specific skills their workforces need. Programs like apprenticeship lite, co-ops, or internships are encouraged to break down the work-learn barrier, fostering coordinated efforts between educational institutions, employers, workers, and students.\nCategories of job tasks\nFrank Levy, along with David Autor and Richard Murnane, developed a framework for analyzing how technological change affects labor markets by classifying job tasks into five distinct categories. This classification helps explain which types of work are most susceptible to automation and which are likely to remain in human hands.\n\nRoutine Cognitive tasks These tasks involve mental processes taht follow well defined procedures and rules(e.g bookkeeping, data entry, and basic clerical work). Because they are rule-based and repetitive, they are highly susceptible to automation and offshoring. Computers and software can perform theses tasks efficiently, leading to a decline in demand for workers who specalize in them.\nRoutine manual tasks These tasks are physical activities that also follow predictable patterns(e.g. assembly line work, machine operation, and packaging). Like routine cognitive tasks, these are vulnerable to automation through robotics and mechanization. Their decline has been notable in manufacturing sectors where machines can replicate human actions with precision.\nNon-Routine analytical tasks These tasks required problem-solving, critical thinking, and the application of spcialized knowledge(e.g. scientific research, engineering, financial analysis, and strategic planning). These tasks are less susceptible to automation because they involve abstract reasoning and adaptability. In fact, technology often complements these rolse by enhancing data analysis and decision-making capabilities.\nNon-Routine Interpersonal Tasks These tasks rely on human interaction, emotional intelligence, and communication skills(e.g. teaching, counseling, sales, and management). They are difficult to automate because they require nuance undestanding of human behavior, persuasion, and empathy. As service-oriented sectors grow, demand for these skills continue to rise.\nNon-Routine manual tasks These tasks involve physical activities that are not easily codified or replicated by machines(e.g. cleaning, cooking, driving in unpredictable environments, and caregiving).While some aspects can be assisted by technologym, the complexity and variability of these tasks make full automation challenging. They often require dexterity, situational awareness, and adaptability.\n\nHealthcare and Social Assistance\nThis is the largest employment sector in the U.S. with over 23.3 million workers. It accounts for approximately 13.9% of the total U.S. labor force, which stands at around 167.8 million. The sector continues to grow due to aging demographis and increasing demand for health services.\nRetail Trade\nRetail employs about 15.2 million workers, making up roughly 9.1% of the total workforce. While still a major employer, the sector has seen slight declines due to e-commerce and automation in logistics and customer service.\nManufacturing\nManufacturing employs approximately 12.75 million workers, representng around 7.6% of the labor force. Though smalller than the other two, it remains vital for economic output and national infrastructure.\n\n\nSMEs & Information Systems\nHistory of SME here\n\n\n\nSmall and Medium Enterprise Framework\n\n\n\n\nModeling Workplace Adaptation\nWorkplace Adjustement: A Theoretical Approach\n\n\n\nA conceptual model for analyzing how individuals adapt to work environments\n\n\n\n\n\nManufacturing-focus Approach\nThe U.S. advanced manufacturing plan, as outlined in resources like manufacturing.gov, aims to increase productivity, improve supply chains, and retain a strong workforce.\n\nShift Focus from Design to Manufacturing\nThe U.S. must recognize that while innovation in product design is important, the real competitive advantage lies in mastering manufacturing processes. This means investing heavily in research and development of manufacturing technologies, such as advanced robotics, AI-driven quality control, and sustainable production methods.\n\n“Manufacturing is underrated and design overrated”. This suggests that the initial design of a product, such as a rocket engine, is just the beginning. The real challenge lies in scaling that design into a manufacturable, cost-effective, and reliable, product.\n\nThe effort to design a manufacturing system is exponentially greater than the effort to design the product. For instance, that designing the Raptor engine required significantly less effort compared to designing the manufacturing system to produce it at scale. This is because manufacturing involves not just producing one unit but thousands, each with consistent quality and at a reduced cost.\n\n\nEmbrace Vertical Integration\nTo reduce vulnerability to global supply chain disruptions and improve control over production quality, the U.S. should encourage policies that support vertical integration. This could involve incentives for companies to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. or to develop domestic supplier networks. The National Strategy for Advanced Manufacturing should prioritize building a robust ecosystem that supports end-to-end production.\nSpaceX’s success is partly due to its vertical integration strategy, where the company controls most aspects of production, from raw materials to final assembly. This approach reduces dependency on external suppliers, improves quality control, and lowers costs. Musk’s emphasis on process engineering means optimizing every step of the manufacturing process, from supply chain logistics to automation, to ensure efficiency and scalability.\n\n\nInvest in Workforce Training for Manufacturing\nThe U.S. must invest in training programs that focus on advanced manufacturing skills, such as process engineering, automation, and data analytics. Programs like apprenticeships, community college partnerships, and industry-led training initiatives can bridge the skills gap.\n\n\nPrioritize Cost Efficiency and Scalability\nU.S. manufacturers need to adopt a cost-conscious approach, where design constraints include economic viability at scale. This might involve rethinking traditional manufacturing paradigms to incorporate modular designs, additive manufacturing(3D printing), and other techonologies that reduce waste and increate flexibility.\nA critical aspect of SpaceX approach is desgning with cost in mind from the outset. They challenges the team to achieve a cost per ton of thrust under $1000 for the Raptor engine, which is a formidable constraint that drives innovation in both design and manufacturing. This cost-focused approach is not just about cutting expenses but about reimagining how products are made to be economically viable at scale.\nSpaceX advocates for accelerating cycle times but only after ensuring the design and process are optimized. This iterative approach allows for continuous improvement and adaptation, which is crucial in high-stakes industries like aerospace where failure is not an option.\n\n\nLeverage Data and Automation\nThe future of manufacturing is digital, and the U.S. must lead in adopting Industry 4.0 technologies. This includes IoT(Internet of Things) for real-time monitoring, AI for predictive maintenance, and advanced robotics for precision manufacturing. These technolgies can significantly reduce cycle times and improve quality.\n\n\nPolicy Support for Innovation in Manufacturing Processes\nThe U.S. government should provide incentives for innovation in manufacturing processes, not just product design. This could include tax breaks for companies that invest in new manufacturing technologies, grants for research into process optimization, and regulatory support for pilot projects that test new manufacturing methodologies.\n\n\nCollaborative Ecosystems\nBuilding collaborative ecosystems where academia, industry, and government work together can foste innovation in manufacturing. Universities can develop curricula focused on manufacturing engineering, industry can provide real-world applications, and goverment can fund initiatives that bridge the gap between theory and practice.",

    "text": "Lean Six Sigma\nWhat Are These Classes About ?\n\nMIT offers 17 classes introducing lean principes and Six Sigma methods, presented by professor Earll Murman, Hugh McManus, Annalisa Weigel, Bo Madsen and more.\nRecommended book: Kaizen Express: Fundamentals for Your Lean Journey by Toshiko Narusawa and John Shook\nAdditional useful video: *Industry Talks E11: James P. Womak - available on YouTube.\n\nSummary\n\nOverview of productivity, quality defects, and training hours, highlighting differences between North American and Japanese manufacturing in 1990.\nLean thinking is a knowledge-driven, customer-focused approach in which everyone within an enterprise continuously work to eliminate waste and create value. Organizations often adopt their own branded version of lean(e.g., GE Aviation-Flight Deck, Pratt&Whitney-ACE, U.S.Air force-AFS021, Boeing-Lean+, NYC Health + Hospitals - Breakthrough)\nLean thinking is both a mindset and a set of practices focused on creating more value with fewer resources. It involves continuous experimentation and improvement to eliminate waste and optimize the entire value stream from raw materials to the customer.\n\nTypes of value in process steps\n\nValue added process steps: Transform or shape materials.\nNecessary waste process steps: Regulatory, project coordinations.\nPure waste process steps: Excess moviment, inventory, wait time, rework, confusion(information process).\n\nValue Stream map\nIdentify all the steps involved in delivering value and eliminate non-value-adding activities.\n\nElements of a process, process map, value in a process, five fundamental lean principles, concepts and tools for implementing lean principles.\nProcess is a series of actions, changes, or functions which transform inputs to outputs.\nCustomers also drive the inputs to a process through their needs and requirements.\n\nContinuous flow\n\nFlow: Ensure a smooth and continuous flow of work through the value stream.\nPull: Produce only what is needed, when it is needed.\nPerfection: Continuously strive for perfection by eliminating waste and improving processes.\n\nSocial contract or contancy of purpose\nLean’s succes hinges on a strong social contract between employees and the company, supporting a culture of continuous improvement with the aim to become competitive and to stay in business, and to provide jobs. Workers will only contribute ideas if they feel the arrangement is fair and mutually beneficial. Employees are commited to dedicate themselves to their jobs, while the company is commited to provide opportunities for skill development, enabling employees to defend their jobs.\nHosing Kanri focuses on aligning the entire organization around a few critical strategic objectives. It involves setting clear goals, developing action plans, and monitoring progress towards those goals.\nToyota started in 1935 and they only got their system perfected by the mid-1960s. It took them 25+ years of experiments and they’ve struggled across the world to maintain the standard as they’ve grown.\nShifting from KPIs to Problem-Solving or instead of giving orders and say do that, do this, they say “Okay, here’s the problem, here is the gap that we’re trying to close, what are you going to do, how can I help?” That is a different conversation than “make your numbers”.\nAccording to James P. Womack (2022), reducing inventory should not be the primary focus, but rather a result of improving capability and reducing variability. He emphasizes that simply decreasing inventory reduction without addressing underlying issues will lead to stockouts and dissatisfied customers.\nStandard Inventory\nIn the Lean world, standard inventory is the necessary amout to protect the customer and maintain a smooth production flow that includes:\n\nSafety stock: To buffer againg process incapability\nBuffer stock: To absorb variations in uptream processes\nShipping stock: To accommodate shipping frequency\n\nFocus on Capabilty and Variability\n\nImprove process capability to consistently produce good results, reducing the need for safety stock.\nEmploy Heijunka (production leveling) to smooth demand and minimize buffer stock.\nIncrease shipping frequency to reduce shipping stock.\n\nInventory as a consequence\nWhen capability improves and variability decreases, the need for standard inventory naturally diminishes, leading to lower inventory levels. In a high-interest-rate environment, reducing inventory becomes even more crucial, as excess inventory ties up capital. In world war 2, Toyota focus on minimizing inventory due to the high cost of money in Japan.\nContinuous improvement\nEvolution of Lean Implementation that has shifted from a consultant-driven. “quick-fix” approach to a coaching model that empowers employees to identify and solve problems themselves. Every day, everyone is involved in eliminating waste, making their jobs easier and taking pride in their work.\nGenchi genbutsu principles, relying on data and observations produced by others does not give a complete understanding. This meaning go to the actual place, talk to the actual people, doing the actual work\n\nValue and Muda(Waste)Types of Muda(Waste)Value Stream MapCost price relationship\n\n\n\n\n\nValue-added and Waste\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of Muda(Waste)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValue Stream Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of Cost price relationship - adapted from MIT lectures\n\n\n\n\n\nTools of Lean principles\nProcess mapping is a graphical representation of an idea or steps using texts, illustrations, ideograms or greometric figures. The idea is to provide a clear vision of the whole thing, the flow of elements in the drawing, and the direction they go Anjos (2024)\nBasic stability\nLean focused on reduce waste and six sigma focused on reduced variation creating a basic estability preparing the environment for implementation of Lean.\n\nProcess mappingProcess guided by strategyWhy mapping process?Basic stability - prcess controlProcess Control and CapabilityProcess control chartsFive SFive WhysIshikawa diagram\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of a mapping process for opening stores at Portobello\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of Strategy-driven processes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess design throughout the business life cycle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of basic stability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Control and Process Capability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControl variability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFive S\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFive Whys\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncause and Effect diagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Root Causes: A Scientific, Evidence-Based Approach\n\n\n\n\n\nPreventing short-sighted or palliative decisions from leading to unintended consequences requires a meticulous and systematic study of cause-and-effect relationships. Whithout this depth of understanding, interventions can consume significant resources(e.g., time, money) during later efforts o reorganize systems.\nA compelling illustrations of this principle is the case of the Large Blue Butterfly in southern England. Recent research has revealed a positive correlation between the success conservation of the butterfly and the preservation of Myrmica ants and thyme plants. The ants carry thyme seeds to their nests, along with butterfly larvae. Due to physical and chemical mimicry, the Phengaris caterpillars(Large Blue larvae) deceive the ants using a “cuckoo strategy”–a form of brood parasitism– by preying on ant larvae or begging for food as if they were genuine ant offspring, ensuring the survival and proliferation of the butterfly species. This complex interaction is essential for the betterfly’s survival and reproduction.\nThese intricate ecological relationship were not understood in 1970s, when some countries attempted to control rabbit overpopulation to protect crops. However, rabbits played a crucial role in maintaining short grass. Once their population was reduced, the grass grew rapidly, cooling the soil and creating an unfavorable environment for the thyme plants and Myrmica ants. As the Ants disappeared, so did the butterflies that depended on them. This disruption led to the extinction of the Large Blue Butterfly, and it took 40 years of intensive scientific research to restore the ecosystem.\nInterestingly, data later disproved the theory that butterfly collectors caused the species’ decline. Ironically, measures to deter them–like fencing–excluded grazing animals, accelerating grass growth and habitat loss.\nProfessor Earll Murman, in his MIT OpenCourseWare lectures, compares industry training hours in Japan (380.3) to those in the United States(46.4). While the value of training is difficult to measure is the short term, studies like the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve offer insights into the cause-and-effect relationship between consistent training and long-term expertise.\n\n\n\nSorce: MIT by Earll Murman, Hugh McManus, Annalisa Weigel and Bo Madsen\n\n\nInnovation Systems\nWhat is it ?\n\nThere are 20 classes with an introduction to Innovation Systems for Science, Technology, Energy, Manufacturing, and Health, published by MIT and presented by professor William Bonvillian.\n\nSummary\n\nInnovation: Railroad, telegraph, electricity, quality manufacturing, Internet 2000, Energy systems.\n\nImportant factors\n\nSolow MIT: You got to do R&D to achieve technological innovation\nPaul Romer Stanford: Human capital engaged in research (talent base) to drive economic growth.\nDale Jorgenson Harvard: Core technology + driven the economic growth and innovation.\nMerryl Linch: Venture capital.

This includes $39 billion in manufacturing incentives Hawkins (2024)\nIntel has been awarded $8.5 billion in grants and $11 billion on loan guarantees for new chip fab construction under the CHPS Act acording to Manufacturing@MIT (2024). Pat Gelsinger CEO of the company is in 3 years into a turn-around strategy to get back to advanced chip production leadership, and argued the cutbacks were necessary to generate funding for his strategy of building a foundry business to achieve 5 nodes in 4 years. Bad decisions are made along the way such as make gpu chips for AI, adopting advanced lithography, and expand beyond its very profitable x86-based desktop and server chip business.\n\nIn Dec 2, 2024 CFO David Zinsner and Michelle Holthaus will serve as interim CEOs of Intel while the board searches for a sucessor for Mr. Gelsinger. Chip design involves creating the specifications and architecture of semiconductor chips, while foundries are specialized manufacturing facilities that produce these chips based on the designs provided by companies. Essentially, chip designers focus on the conceptual side, and foundries handle the physical production.\nIn Mar 12, 2024 Intel announced Lip-Bu Tan as a new CEO.\n\nIn Oct, 2025 Wolfspeed received $750 million in grant money from the federal chips act. There is a big transition in products and building a new giant plant for silicon carbide materials in Siler City(Chatham County) and other in Upstate New York. Wolfspeed is also partening with local community colleges to offer courses to people who would want to work at the factory that they called TCP or technician certification progam.\nIn Mar 4, 2025 TSMC announces $100 billion more in Phoenix, AZ manufacture site. At total now of $165 billion investing in more three fullscale fabrication facilities, two new packaging plants, and one R&D center.\n\n\n\nBattery and electricity\n\nAcording to Manufacturing@MIT (2024), lithium-ion betteries were invented in United States, but never built the needed supply chains, government support was missing, and batteries faced political and industrial opposition.\nChina that has seized the lead in battery technology, leading battery manufacturing, and making technical progress. The firm A123 was bought for a Chinese company that was transferred its significant technology, then scaled these advances, putting them into domestic hybrid then electric vehicles built with massive government support.\nDry-process maufacturing with its electrode printing eliminates the use of solvents and enables the use of new process in battery manufacturing that will enable cost-effective, higher performance batteries that are also environmentally friendly.\nMujeeb Ijaz founder, CEO of Our next energy Michigan made cells LFP technolgy, R&D Center in Fremont California and another one in Boston and Bedford shows us the 3 gerenation analysis about energy storage at MIT Mobility Initiative (2023)\n\n\n\n\nEvolution of energy storage adapted from Mujeeb Ijaz’s presentation\n\n\n\nYet-Ming Chiang is professor of material science and engineering at MIT co-founder of A123 Systems, co-founder of Form Energy, and co-founder of 24M technologies.\n\nWhat is the limits of energy storage?\nEnergy density\nHe talks about Arpa-e energy gov call for proposals propel 1k that refers to on thousand watt hours per kilogram. Today EV’s is pushing to 250 watt hours per kilogram. So 1K is about planes, trains and ships. To put in perspective the chemistries that we know of today the top and of about 4 kWh/kg and what we are all trying to do is figure it out how to make those usable low cost enough and by the time you get to a system that exceeds what we’re doing today.\nObs: Innolith Switzerland-based company with labs in Germany claims it’s on path to 1000 Wh/kg or (1kWh/kg) battery energy density to enable the production of vehicles with 620 miles range(1000 km). Meanwhile, in Japan researchers at Yokohama National University have demonstrated different approach using manganese in the anode to create a high-energy density 820 Wh/kg with.\n\nMartin Bazant professor of chemical engineering and mathematics at MIT director of center for battery sustainability, co-founder of Lithios an advanced lithium extraction from brins using electrochemistry.\n\nTransition to LFP is the scientific problem for the last 20 years such as industrilize, build supply chain, sustainability and circularity of these different materials, how to do all this domestically.\n\nChirstina Lampe-Onnerud founder and CEO of Cadenza Innovation. She talks about basic research with the goal to make safe, low cost and performance just right, systemitized and data truth.\n\n\n\nSMM’s - Small, Medium Manufacturers\nThe task here is to research the possibilities in the small and medium manufacturing sector considering the market, historic aspects, and the innovation theory of Bonvillian and Paul Romer.\n\nManufacturing as a service SendCutSend (2024) and Fussell (2024)\nDev kit’s serving as a catalyts for creativity and scientific discovery when the innovators can quickly test and validate their hypoteses, fostering a culture of experimentation and risk-taking. By providing access to cutting-edge hardware, these kits empower people from diverse backgrounds to angage in hands-on experimentation and prototyping Breaking Taps (2024). This, in turn, enables the rapid iteration and refinement of design concepts, accelerating the journey from idea to reality. As a result, dev kits have become an essential tool for driving innovation, fueling breakthroughs, and pushing the boundaries of what is possIble while creating an environment for exapanding supply chain capabilities and knowledge base lgarlati and Gonzalez (2024)\n\n\n\nPharmaceutical\n\nSolid dosage products still account for the majority of medicinal products made worldwide, but there are some hurdles to overcome in order to make the tablet of the future. Issues such as patient centricity, solubility, bioavailability conversion of parental products to solid dosage forms are all topics that need to be addressed.\nQuality, variability, new processes, supply chain, and inspection\nSmart pill such as electronic capsule for tageting drug to delivery system.\nThe world cancer incidence is increasing from 15 million cases every year to probably +30 million in 2050 reflecting a demographic shifts around the world, people live longer, risk factors and better ways to detecting cancer. The mortality rate actually going down in the last 30 years. The goals is treatment such as target therapy to be targeting cancer cells only that express some specific proteins that attract the antibody like GPS system process.\n\n\n\nAviation and Jet Egines\n\nJet engine is important part of commerial airplane and reparing them has become a $58 billion business acording to @cnbc2024. A commercial jet engine is a complex, expensive machine made up of thousands of parts and cost of $10 million each one or $6 million for overhaul. The process of overhauling one means disassembling it and replacing all the worn on damaged parts like blades, which can cost up to $20.000 a piece and HPT( high pressure turbine) costing more then $30.000 a piece, and one engine aproximately 40 to 60 of them is necessary. Before the supply chain issues, a typical narrowbody engine took 60 to 75 days to overhaul, and that time has gone up, in some cases to over 200 days because it’s not sufficient spare parts, labor to do this in normal time.\nJet engine manufacturing is dominated by GE Aerospace(12.81%), CFM/Safran(44.77%), Rools-Royce(19.57%) and Pratt & Whitney (22.85%). More than 70% of GE’s commercial engine revenue comes from partes and service, and first two quarters of 2024 GE reported over $15 billion in MRO(maintenance, repair and overhaul) versus $8 billion for new engines.\n\n\nGE Aerospece delivered a strong finish to 2024 given robust demand for our services and products with fourth quarter orders up 48%, EPS more than doubling, and free cash flow increasing over 20%.\nLooking to 2025, we expect double-digit revenue and EPS growth wth greather than 100% free cash flow conversion. Guided by Flight Deck, our proprietary lean operating model, I’m confident in our ability to accelerate output and deliver for our customers\n— Larry Culp - GE Aerospace Chairman and CEO\n\n\nIn U.S. there are over three thousand aircraft repair shops, and the most commonly flown jet engine is CFM56 that 80 to 85% part commonality between engines resulting in a very good reuse capability. The engine has parts which are life time limited and the safe operation of the engine is guaranteed up to 25 to 30 thousand cycles. In the hottest part of a jet engine in 2024, the temperature surrounding the turbine blade is several hundred degrees above the melting point of the material of the turbine blade. Aproximately 1200 parts per engine and many stages for overhauling.\n\nBreak the major flange and then it’ll be separated into the cold and the hot section.\nBroken down into piece and then the parts are cleaned and inspected.\nTesting process envolve techniques such as ultrasound, x-ray, magnetic inspection and fluorescent penetrant that is spray parts with a lime green fluorescent penetrant, and it seeps into the surface of the parts and any subsurface defects. They use a black light for the fluorescent to be little more brilliant and help signify where some of those defects are located Hradecky (2011).\n\nSupply chain issues are expected to persist in an a airline manufacturing and MRO shops raising concerns about rising maintenance costs.\n\n\n\n\nSmartphone\nIn 1990, the United States used to be a global leader in manufacturing, but in 2010, China passed the U.S. going from 3.5% in 1990 to 30.5% in 2021.\nApple and Alphabet hire and send thousands of employees abroad to eversea manufacturing. It was common to send 20,40 engineers at a time to the factory to support prototyping builds to do that learning and finding and fixing of issues and be in the right place at the right time. Apple buying 50 business class seats from San Francisco to Shanghai daily, accounting for $150 million in annual revenue for United Air Lines.\n\nThe popular conception is that companies come to China because of low labor cost. I’m not sure what part of China they go to, but the truth is China stopped being the low labor cost country many years ago and that is not the reason to come to China from a supply point of view. The reason is because of the skill and the quantity of skill in one location and the type of skill it is.\n— Tim Cook - CEO of Apple\n\nAcording to Helwig and Goldman (2024) , manufacturing is subject to learning effect and making high value-added technology products requires specialized process knowledge and when firms or nations stop producing something, developing that capability again is an uphill battle.\nManufacturing process demand a lot of skill and a lot of local supply chain for where all the parts are going to come from to build such a complex product that makes it a very appealing place to build.\nAll products of Apple are designed and engineered in US and they all include components manufactured in U.S. (e.g. iPhone glass is made in Kentucky, and lasers that enable Face ID are built in the U.S. too.). In 2023 Apple annouced $430 billion in new investments across the country, including work with more than nine thousand suppliers across all fifty states in U.S. acording CNBC (2022)\n\nsource: Steve Jobs at MIT 1992\nsource: r’\n\nIn 2012 Google buy Motorola for $12.5 billion and open smartphone manufacturing plant in Fort Worth Texas to build Moto X. The goals was build as American made low cost smartphone but about a year after it opened, the plant shut down, citing high demestic operating costs and low consumer demand. Google sold Motorola to Lenovo for a multibillion dollar loss. Some experts says the U.S. failure shows that the cost of labor and the lack of skill in the U.S. is why manufacturing in the country is not cost effective.\nFoxconn is Apple’s largest supplier and the world’s largest electronic manufacturer. Acording to Yeung (2022) Chairman Terry Gou sayd the core skills and the capabilities of making phones, manufacturing, electronics have moved to Asia and for it to come to America it would be difficult, though not impossible. In 2017, the White House announced Foxconn’s plan to invest $10 billion, and open a massive LCD screen manufacturing facility in Wisconsin creating a 13.000 jobs.\nA smartphone made in America cost $2.000 dollars but the same product made in China cost $1.300, it’s $700 cheaper than the American-made model. The supply chain doesn’t exist. Labor intensive positions is a challange and needs to rebuild.\n\nI worked and managed manufacturing electronics and semiconductors for 30 years. I’ve visited China on manufacturing activities multiple times. I became management and can see the financial statements. In the 1990’s and early 2000’s, labor cost in Asia was the driver. This drove supply chain to go to Asia, even the most complex manufacturing and less labor intensive like chip manufacturing. So in 2000’s it’s supply chain as driver. In the end, it’s profit margin that is driving the companies to manufacture in Asia, particularly China. The US and Europe have given up even their low labor intensive manufacturing capability (chip foundries) and even design capability (engineers are cheaper in Asia). They could still make a profit by manufacturing in the US, but that profit may be only 10% compared to 30% if made in Asia (mostly China). So the root cause is profit MARGIN, not profit.\nFor Beginners and Beyound channel at YouTube\n\n\n\nAutomotive\nTesla Manufacturing by Munro Live and Lars Moravy\nTour of the Giga Factory in Austin Texas by Lars Moravy and Sandy Munro Munro Live (2023) and show how to build the panels for the Tesla Cybertruck.

To improve the scrap utilization the coils are tuned to the parts(optimization system), that’s why we don’t have to weld anything together.\nTransfer presses that the small one make a small parts there we actually insourced about 70% of stampings for model Y and Cybertruck\nPart separation section where the good parts are separated by suction machines while the scrap is sent to the scrap house through gravity and conveyor belt.\nStack parts: Overhead conveyor belts where parts actually come through and drops. It’s very important we don’t the only thing that really can’t screatch HFS is HFS. So we got to be careful when we put it down that we’re not rubbing it againt each other.\nStorage parts: Different blanks all within accuracy tailgate, face hood, doors\nMeasurement system: Basically we have a periodic quality check, take the part put it on a 2d light scanner machine (giant optical comparator) that compare the cut the we’re cutting to in relation to what we’re actually measuring. The results is a level of micron precision that it’s very important for the Elon perspective (japanese uniformity cpk 1.67/2.00). Below is the attention mentioned by the engineer. I also made a graph using the R programing language to illustrate the idea of uniformity Kume (1987)\n\n\n\nWe got to be careful because we’re doing periodic checks to be to make sure this machine has a good CP or CPK or repeatability as what we call it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggQC)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\n#plot a data\nset.seed(1221)\ndata_norm_dist &lt;- \n  data.frame(process_id = 1:1000,\n             sub_group = rep(1:20, each = 5),\n             process_value = rnorm(n = 1000, mean = 10, sd = .5))\n\n#Capability plot\na &lt;- data_norm_dist %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = process_value ))+\n  geom_histogram(bins = 30)+\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(process_value)),\n             linetype = \"dashed\")+\n  stat_QC_Capability(LSL = 8,\n                     USL = 12,\n                     show.cap.summary = c(\"Cp\",\"Cpk\"),\n                     cap.summary.size = 3,\n                     method = \"XmR\")+\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(.15,.6)))+\n  labs(subtitle = \"Maintenace of the present state is all that is needed\",\n       x = \"\")\n\n\n#plot b data\nset.seed(1230)\ndata_dist_lim &lt;- \n  data.frame(process_id = 1:1000,\n             sub_group = rep(1:20, each = 5),\n             process_value = rnorm(1000,10,.5658713))\n\nb &lt;- \n  data_dist_lim %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = process_value))+\n  geom_histogram(bins=30)+\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(process_value)),\n             linetype = \"dashed\")+\n  stat_QC_Capability(LSL = 8,\n                     USL = 12,\n                     show.cap.summary = c(\"Cp\",\"Cpk\"),\n                     cap.summary.size = 3,\n                     method = \"XmR\")+\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = expand_scale(mult = c(.15,1)))+\n  labs(subtitle = \"The spec is satisfied, but there is no extra margin\",\n       x = \"\")\n\n#plot c data\nset.seed(1223)\ndata_dist_out &lt;- \n  data.frame(process_id = 1:1000,\n             sub_group = rep(1:20, each = 5),\n             process_value = rnorm(1000,8.9,.5))\n\nc &lt;- \n  data_dist_out |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = process_value))+\n  geom_histogram(bins = 30)+\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(process_value)),\n             linetype = \"dashed\")+\n  stat_QC_Capability(LSL = 8,\n                     USL = 12,\n                     show.cap.summary = c(\"Cp\",\"Cpk\"),\n                     cap.summary.size = 3,\n                     method = \"XmR\"\n  )+\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = expand_scale(mult = c(.15,.6)))+\n  labs(subtitle = \"It is necessary to take measures to bring the mean closer to the middle\",\n       x = \"\")\n\n#plot d data\nset.seed(1224)\ndata_dist_amp &lt;- \n  data.frame(process_id = 1:1000,\n             sub_group = rep(1:20, each = 5),\n             process_value = rnorm(1000,10,2))\nd &lt;- \n  data_dist_amp %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = process_value))+\n  geom_histogram(bins = 30)+\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(process_value)),\n             linetype = \"dashed\")+\n  stat_QC_Capability(LSL = 8,\n                     USL = 12,\n                     show.cap.summary = c(\"Cp\",\"Cpk\"),\n                     cap.summary.size = 3,\n                     method =\"XmR\")+\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = expand_scale(mult = c(.15,.6)))+\n  labs(subtitle = \"This requires action to reduce the variation\",\n       x = \"\")\n\n#show all plots\n#a + b + c + d + plot_annotation(tag_levels = \"A\", tag_prefix = \"Plot:\")\na + b + c + d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRobotics\nGeneral idea\n\nRobots becoming increasingly prevalent in almost every industry, from healthcare and manufacturing to defense and education.\n\nWelding\nTeaching\nAssemling cars\nPerforming surgery\n\n\n\nRobots Manufacturing\n\nKuka Augsburg, Germany: Industrial robots and factory automation systems.
