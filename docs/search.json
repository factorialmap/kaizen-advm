    "text": "Sectors 2Q24\n\nOverall\nRevenue’s cash flow is a challenge which has a short-term effect on supply chains, labor market, and debt costs as some of them are backed by revenue. Generally, in these cycles, highly leveraged companies tend to file for bankruptcy which are important to observe, mainly due to volatility. The perception of high interest rates and monetary tightening make it difficult to pass on prices to the consumer, leading business to adjust their processes striving for efficiency. Other behaviors:\n\nTemporary rise in unemployment rates, however withour sudden moviments. The job losses begin at the lowest rungs in terms of skills, educational attainment, income making capacity. This indicators are being closely monitored by FED officials and the signals can be seen in Mr. Powell’s statements.\nDecisions by companies towards reducing costs(COGS) and operating expenses(SG&A).\nTemporary increase in the cost of capital for privet debt.\nSupply chain reorganization.\nIncrease of risk of plain vanilla recession.\n\n\n\nAgroindustry\n\n2023 was an incredible year for agriculture, with high productivity for wheat and corn. In 2024, the harvest is a little late(e.g South Dakota area). There was high intensity of rainfall at the beginning of planting with mild temperatutes, causing the crop not to develop as much as in 2023. During the wheat harvest, usually in August, the corn needs more rain to fill the grain, but this year there was not so much during this period.\nThe distortions generated during the pandemic is make 2024 a year of adjusments that are being faced by growers, agricultural auto manufacturing, and machinery and equipment sales, temporarily affeting jobs.\nLooking for agricultural prices, they are still not good. The expectation is not for a bad year, but it will not be as good as 2023. Sales of new equipment have fallen, making it necessary to adjust costs and expenses in companies such as John Deer and CNH industrial.\n\n\n\nAutomotive\n\nThe automotive industry faces many challenges in 2024. Slowing growth, increased competition, supply chain disruptions generated during the pandemic and business decisions caused distortions in costs and prices that grew way above the population’s income and general inflation rates. This process may take a few years to stabilize.\nThe volume of new car sales does not follow the same trend as population growth. It requires a deeper analysis to identify cause-and-effect relationships, but for now, the hypotheses raised are accessibility and the durability of the vehicles Autoline Network (2024).\n\nFrom a price perspective, historically, it takes 25 weeks of average household income to buy a new vehicle. The average household income in 2024 is $75.000($1.400 per week) which would be enough to buy a vehicle worth $36.000 dollars.\nThe age of the vehicles on the road in the United States is 12.6 years acording to Parekh and Campau (2024)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancial data from auto industry in the second quarter of 2024.\n\n\n\n\nAuto sales by brand 2Q24\n\n\n\nReducing costs and prices, increasing household income, and finding more sources of revenue such as subscription services are some options that can be observed in the market.\n\n\n\nTransportation\nThere was overcapacity in carrier population during the period from 2020 to 2023 due to demand that has been inconsistent over time and is currently undergoing adjustments. However, capacity still presents high values in relation to volumes pressuring agents to adjust their operations in striving for efficiency gains. Some of those carriers are contracting and reducing their fleets sizes in order to move forward. On the other side the carriers population are reduced in 32.500 from december of 2022 to june of 2024.\n\nTender rejections are currently in 4.5%, and diesel prices are $3.81 per gallon on average.\nDry van in spot market currently $1.96 per mile 0.2% YoY and -11.5% over five years(2019).\nReefer in spot market currently $2.30 per mile -1% YoY and -9% over five years(2019).\nFlat bed in spot market currently $2.34 per mile -1% YoY and -7% over five years(2019).\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\nIn 2024 investments in disruptive technologies continue to show accelerated growth. The highlight has been in generative AI, which is unlocking possibilities for innovation between interconnected processes such as robotics and augmented reality.\nFactors such as macroeconomic, geopolitical environment, and intense competition influence the adoption of technology as alternatives to improve operational efficiency in business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe innovation process has accelerated, driven by the development of large generative AI models, known as foundation models. These foundation models are then utilized by specialized applications that build upon them to perform more specific tasks. Finally, traditional processes are leveraging the applications to achieve efficiency gains, create new processes, and develop new value-added products.\n\nInfraestructure\n\nComputing: Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Nvidia\nAI foundation models: OpenAI(Msft), Anthropic(Google/Amazon), Cohere(Nvidia)\nModel development & deployment: Modular(Google)\nSysthetic data: Hazy(Microsoft)\n\nHorizontal AI\nHorizontal AI refers to AI systems that have a broad range of capabilities and can be applied across multiple industries, domais, or tasks.

    "text": "PDCA Method and Quality Tools in Manufacturing\n\nUse of Machine Learning Models and Generative AI in PDCA Method and Quality Tools implementation\n\nWhat is the basic idea behind PDCA?\nWhat is the basic idea behind Lean principles?\nWhat is the basic idea behind the quality tools?\nWhy is it essential in Japanese manufaturing and around the globe?\nIs it possible to use generative AI in the implementation and regular use of these principles in a manufacturing process?\n\nMississippi Community College and Golden Triangle Development Link Project\n\nWhat is the basic idea behind the Golden Triangle Development Link Project\nWhat is so important\n\n\nCEE - Council for Economic Education and the Economic and Personal Finance Education programs\n\nWhat is the basic idea behind the Personal Finance Education?\nWhy is this important in the process of returning manufacturing to the United States?\nWhat is the role and impact of CEE on financial education programs?\n\nTalk about Robotics Career in Manufacturing by RoboticsCareer org\n\nWhat is the basic idea behind the Robotics in manufacturing?\nWhy is this importnat in the process of returning manufacturing to the United States?\nWhat is the role and impact of RoboticsCareer on Robotic Training?\n\n\n\n\nData Science in Manufacturing\n\nBasically data science is solving real problems using data to create as much impact as possible for a business or a system. Impacts can be the form of insights, data products or data recomendations. To do this, data scientists need tools like machine learning models, data visualizations, technical reports, dashboards , and more.\nThe principles of data science involves breaking down complex problems into fundamental truths, gathering data from various sources, identifying and correting errors and inconsistencies to ensure its quality, analyzing data visualy and statistically to uncover patterns and insights, transforming and selecting variables and using techniques such as statistics, programming, and machine learning to build descriptive models that are helpful to descrie or illustrate characteristics of data, inferencial models to produce a decision for a research question or to explore a specific hypothesis, and predictive models to produce the most accurate prediction possible for new data Kuhn and Silge (2022).\nAmong the foundations of data science, two stand out as fundamental:\n\nScientific, which would basically be asking “why” and demanding a rational answer to que question. It requires abilities such as ask insightful questions, active listening, strong orgazational skills, and effective communication of complex ideas in simple terms. As data science often involves sensitive information, understanding ethical considerations and data privacy is critical. This ensures that data is used responsibly and in compliance with regulations\nTechnical, which would basically the application of technical or scientific knowledge or both to something with a practical purpose. it requires abilities in statistics and probability such as data distributions and statistical tests, programming like Python and R, ability to represent data visually for communicating findings, and machine learning that involves training models to make predictions or decisions based on data.\n\nAs impact of data science on manufacturing we can mention insights into product performance, identify areas for improvement, and develop targeted solutions to reduce warranty claims and improve customer satisfaction. Some examples of practical application are shown below.\n\nIndetify patterns and trends in warranty claims data.\nDevelop predictive models for forecast potential warranty claims.\nAnalyzie the root cause of product defects and develop corrective actions.\nOptimize warranty claims processing and reduce costs.\nStop a machine in an emergency situation, avoiding accidents.\nIdentify fatigue in equipment and workers based on movements patterns.\n\nLooking at the history of use of data in manufacturing processes, we cansay that in the past, manufacturing processes relied heavily on manual labor and basic automation. Data collection was limited and carried out manually through notes, and quality control often involved small sampling. Today, advanced sensors, IoT devices, and AI-driven analytics enable real-time monitoring of production lines, predictive maintenance, and quality control. Machine learing algorithms help in identifying patterns and anomalies, leading to proactive decision-making. Looking forward, autonomous decision-making, adaptive manufacturing systems, and personalized production will coexist. Data integration across supply chains and the adoption of digital twins will enable virtual simulations for testing and optimization before physical production begins. Use of cyber-physical systems will reduce the boundaries between the physical and digital, with smart-manufacturings capable of self-otimization, atomic-level vision capability and real-time response to market demand.\nSome examples os pratical application os data science on manufacturing including:\n\nPredictive Analysis: To monitor businesss operations, performance, and potential solutions to problems impeding future prospects. Machine learning and deep learning are used to predict energy consumption, mechanical properties, and other performance metrics.\nMaintenace: Predict equipment failures, enabling manufacturers to take proactive measures to avoid or mitigate them. By leveraging predictive analytics techniques, manufaturers can identify potential issues before they occur, reducing downtime and increasing overall efficiency. Traditional time-based preventative maintenance strategies can be augmented with data-driven insights, allowing for more informed decision-making and optimized maintenance planning. With careful planning and analysis, equipment manufacturers can schedule maintenance breaks or shutdowns to address potential problems, minimizing delays and failures. This proactive approach helps ensure equipment reliability, reduces maintenance costs and optimizes production output.\nPrice reduction: To optimize their pricing strategies, leading to significant cost reductions. When setting product prices, manufaturers must consider a multitude of factors, including raw material costs, manufacturing expenses, distribution fees, maintenance costs, and more. To strike the perfect balance between profitability and customer affordability, manufacturers leverage price optimization techniques. By analyzing pricing and cost data from both internal and external sources, data science anables manufaturers to gain a competitive edge and develop optimized price variants. This data-driven approach allows manufacturers to identify areas of inefficiency, minimize costs, and maximize revenue, ultimately leading to increased profitability and a stronger market presence. Manufacturers can make informed pricing decisions that drive business growth, improve profitability, ad enhance customer satisfaction.\n\nGain a deeper understanding of their cost structure and identify opportunities for reduction.\nAnalyze market trends and competitor pricing to inform their own pricing strategies.\nAnalyze macro economic trends\nDevelop targeted pricing models that account for variations in customer demand and market conditions.\nOptimize their supply chain and logistics to reduce costs and improve efficiency.\nMonitor and adjust their pricing strategies in real-time to stay ahead of the competition.\n\nSimulations Digital Twin: To simulate and predict the behavior of spaces or manufactured parts under various contiditions, enhancing quality assurance and reducing the need for physical testing Witherell (2024).\n\n\n\nDirecting the Supply Chain: Data science could help manufaturers to navigate risks and uncertainties, providing visibility with the agility they need to respond quickly to changing market conditions and customer needs. Proactively identify potential disruptions, asses their likelihood, and develop strategies to mitigate their impact. Supply chain management requires a deep understanding of the complex variables, including supplier performance, inventory levels, transportation costs, and customer demand. Some examples where data science can be helpful in the supply chain are shown below.\n\nAnalyze real-time data to identify potential bottlenecks and delays.\nAssess the likehood of major disruptions and develop contingency plans.\nEvaluate the performance of suppliers and identify opportunities for improvement.\nOptimize inventory management and reduce waste.\n\nWarranty Analysis: To optimize warranty claims process by analizing data from various sources, including product performance, customer feedback, and warranty claims, manufaturers can identify early warning signs for product failures and take proactive measures to address them. Data scientists can help manufacturers analyze the root causes of product defects, identify patterns and trends, and develop predictive models to forecast potential warranty claims. With the help of AI and warranty analytics, manufacturers can process vast amounts of warranty-related data from multiple sources, including:\n\nProduct sensor data\nCustomer feedback and complaints\nWarranty claims and repair data\nManufacturing and quality control data\n\nProduct Authenticity: Product authenticity is particularly important in the pharmaceutical and food industries, where counterfeit or adulterated products can have serious consequences for public health. Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) is a powerfil analytical technique to help manufacturers to ensuring the authenticity of products across various industries. With the unique spectral signatures of materials, NIRS enables the rapid and non-invasive identification of chemical composition, allowing manufacturers to verify the ahthenticity of their products. The system operates by emitting infrared photons from the light source, which interact with the sample, causing molecular vibrations or stretching within the sample. These interactions result in a spectrum that reflects the properties of the molecules and thei chemical bonds. To extract meaningful information, the spectra undergo specific preprocessing (e.g. PLS,PCA) techniques to eliminate noise and redundat data. Subsequently, these techniques are employed to identify effective wavelengths that precisely classify the product.A well-constructed model can accurately classify the product with minimal error.\n\nExamples of use\n\nVerify the identity of raw materials and finished products.\nDetect adulteration or contamination.\nEnsure compliance with regulatory requirements.\nProtect their brand reputation and intellectual property.\nPrevent financial loesses due to counterfeit products.\n\nCharacteristics of NIRS\n\nFast: NIRS can analyze samples in a matter of second, making it an ideal technique for high-volume production environments.\nCost-effective: Is a relative low-cost technique compared to other analytical methods, making it an attractive option for manufacturers.\nNon-invasive: Is a non-destructive technique, which means that samples remain intact and can be used for further analysis or processing.\n\n\nRobotization and Automation: To perform repetitive, mundane, and hazardous tasks, freeing up human workers to focus on higher-value activities. However, the integration and maintenance of robots can be a significant annual expense for manufaturers. This where data science comes in - by analyzing data from various sources(Exploring more in this topic in the future), manufacturers can optimize robot programming and operation, leading to improved product quality and reduced costs. Some examples of the pratical application of data science in robotis and automation:\n\nAnalyze sensor data from robots to predict and prevent maintenance issues, reducing repair costs and extending equipment lifespan.\nIdentify areas where automation can be improved or expanded, driving further innovation and growth.\nStreamline robot integration and deployment, reducing downtime increasing productivity and availability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nKuhn, Max, and Julia Silge. 2022.

    "text": "Based on Helwig and Goldman (2024), this summary aims to improve my writing skills and understanding of U.S. business analysis and manufacturing process improvement.\nThe texts may contain typos, imcomplete thoughts, and will be subject to ongoing revision and development. In addition to the primary document used to create this summary, I have also drawn upon the reference documents cited within.\n\nAdvanced Manufacturing\n\nAdvanced manufacturing refers to the use of innovative technology, process and methods like intelligent robotics, additive manufacturing, digital twins, and lean principles to accelerate the design and production of physical goods in the material world. As a result, scale and possibilities that was previously impossible, cost reduction, and value-added products in shorter cycles.\nThis approach depends on the close integration of human capital, machining, networking, sensing, and computational capabilities for example automation, robotics, 3D printing, artificial intelligence, and internet of things(IoT) devices into the manufacturing process.\n\n\n\nWhat is the impact ?\n\nProductivity: Streamline production processes by automation, reducing cycle times and labor cost.\nCosts: By optimizing processes and reducing waste.\nSupply Chain: IoT and data analytics can improve visibility and efficiency, reducing lead times and inventory costs.\nJobs and skill requirements: New opportunities in fields like robotics programming, data analysis, and maintenance of advanced machinery.\nQuality: High precision, uniformity and consistency in production.\nCustomization and Flexibility: 3D printing enable on-demand manufacturing of highly customizable products without retooling.\nEnvironmental Impact: By reducing material waste, energy consumption, and gas emissions.\n\n\n\nPast, Present and Future\nThe central idea is to explore past experiences, the present moment, and future possibilities to estimulate our ability of mental time travel. This ability is essential for survival and adaptation, as it helps predict outcomes, learn from mistakes, and build a sense of identity.\nPast Studying the past helps identify how experiences shape the history and influence memory formation, learning, and can aid in trauma treament. But excessive focus on the past can lead to rumination and depressive states.\n\nShorten the distance, improving the flow of traded goods transforming trade, industry, agriculture, and communication in the region and across the country. Erie Canal navigable waterway connecting the great lakes to the atlantic ocean completed in 1825 DPLA (1821) . The objective was to develop the city of New York, which was a point of communication with the world (e.g. port of trade hub), and opened up the MidWest for settlement and agricultural expansion, impacting the marginal product of labor Kaiman, Vandenbroucke, and Wolla (2024). The canal also had profound societal impacts shaping the nation’s economic development in the 19th century:\n\nIt spurred westward migration, enhance commercial trade between regions.\n\nIt contibuted to the rise of new towns along its route.\n\nIt facilitated cultural and political unity between the Northest and the expanding western territories.\n\n\nNew processes: Making better products, faster and cheaper. The idea of the the Bessemer process was observed and described by a german adventurer Johan Mandelsio in 1669 during a trip to Japan, was patented by Henry Bessemer in 1855 in U.S., and pupularized by Andrew Carnegie a business visionary in 1870s, which allowed creation of time machines(e.g. bridges, ships, trains, elevators, pipes for oil and water, and vertical buldings). This process cuts the manufacturing time of single steel rail from two weeks to 15 minutes.\nKnowledge base, science, and data: Improvements in the petroleum refining process using scientific methods, commercial partnerships striving for efficiency in operations, along with product standardization and uniformity. These factors enhanced Rockefeller’s natural leadership capabilities.\nRedefine customer values: Ford, Packard, Apple, Netflix and Tesla are some examples that creates a new damand, delivering an experience previously unknown to consumers.\nLow levels of stress and anxiety: There is a potential association between consistently low levels of stress and anxiety (particularly when individuals or organizations remain in their confort zones) and a loss of economic competitiveness. While confort zone is beneficial for maintaining mental and physical health, can also lead to complacency. Moderate stressors encourage problem-solving, innovation, and adoption of new technologies. In the long term a lack of challenge and growth opportunities can lead to decreased motivation and creativity. Stress is a know driver of cognitive adaptation which is crucial for maintaining productivity in dynamic economic environments. This type of behavior and its consequences could be observed in the 1980s in the United States JustARandomChannel (2019) Peter Santenello (2024) FRONTLINE PBS (2024) and currently in 2024 in Germany DW News (2024).\n\nPresent Focusing on the present helps us undertand how we process information in real time, essential for responding to stimuli quickly and performing daily activities with mindfulness, which reduce stress and enhance well-being. One of the challenges of staying focused on the present is dealing with digital and physical distractions that are present in abundant quantities.\nChallenges\n\nDisruptive technologies: New ideas and old ones that could be explored by integration with emerging technology such as computational capability, genAI, atomic computer vision.\n\nDemographic shifts around the world: People are getting older and more urban.\n\nEconomic activities in emerging markets: Many countries are emerging from poverty, creating opportunities and threats for example new demands, and lower labor costs.\n\nClimate change: New rules to take care of the environment, improving the capacity to adapt and interact with the environment by creating new products and services.\n\nErosion fo U.S. industrial capacity: Over the past few decades, the U.S. has experienced a significant decline in its industrial capacity. In 1980, the U.S. manufactured over 40 percent of global high-technology goods, facing 18 percent today. This decline poses a threat to both economic competitiveness and national security.\n\nPRC’s Dominance: China has emerged as a formidable competitor, cultivation substantial high-tech industrial production capacity and accounting for nearly 30 percent of global manufacturing output. China has strategically prioritized advanced manufacturing as a cornestone of its national rejuvenation strategy.\n\nSkills Gap and Workforce Shortages: Outsourcing production has led to a skills gap in the U.S. workforce. This is compounded by a persistent labor shortage in the manufacturing sector, with a projected shortfall of 2.1 million unfilled jobs by 2030. This shortage hinders the adoption and implementation of advanced manufacturing technologies.\n\nSmall and Medium Manufacturing Adoption Barriers: Small and medium-sized manufacturers contribute the majority of the U.S. manufacturing ecosystem and they face significant obstacles in adopting advanced manufacturing technologies. These include a lacka of access to capital, expertise, and resources for system upgrades and integration.\n\nUnderinvestment in R&D: The U.S. lag as behind other advanced economies in terms of manufacturing-related R&D spending as a percentage of GDP. This underinvestment hampers innovation and the development of cutting-edge manufacturing processes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpportunities\n\nReconceptualize the workforce: The changing nature of manufacturing requires a new approach to workforce development, with a focus on training “technologists” skilled in both engineering and operation of advanced machinery.\n\nLeverage existing programs: The United States can build upon succesful programs like the manufacturing USA program and the Manufacturing Externsion Partnetship(MEP) to accelerate workforce development initiatives.\nFocus on cyber skills: The increasing integration of digital technologies in manufacturing requires a workforce with strong cyber skills.\nDevelop a national talent marketplace: A centralized platform connectiong job seekers with advanced manufacturing opportunities can help to adress workforce shortages.\nLeveraging U.S. Strenths in AI and Software: The U.S. enjoys a significant lead in generative AI, a technology with the potential to transform various facets of advanced manufacturing(e.g.GenAI can creates copilots to helps workers interpret complex factory data and enhance AI-driven design tools that can create product designs from natural language descriptions)\nRebuilding Domestic Production Capacity:\nPublic and Private Investments:\nCollaboration with Allies and Partners:\nReshoring and Scaling Up Production:\n\nFuture Studying the future to understand decision-making processes, planning, and expectation building, which are crucial for strategic goals. Anticipating future scenarios helps analyze consequences and risks, leading to more effective and safer decisions. Imagining alternate possibilities encourages mental flexibility, stimulating creativity and innovation. The challenges is to control anxiety especially in very optimistic or pessimistic projections.\n\nConsistence and Competitiveness on Manufacturing\nPersonal Finance\nManufacturing base\n\n\n\nGoals\n\n\n\nIllustration of processes guided by objectives and strategy\n\n\n\n\nPrinciples\n\nTalk about learning by doing\nTalk about data standards\nTalk about R&D\nTalk about quality, variation, uniformity, deming cycle, shewhart chart etc.\nTalk about scale the materials genome initiative page 23\n\n\n\nAction Plan at a Glance\n\nChips and Science Act and Research and Development, Competition, and Innovation Ac\nInflation Reduction Act\nInvest in America\nWorkforce Education\nAmbitious of industrialize, build the factories, Supply chain, and vertically integrate those Supply chains together.\nOur Next Energy raised capital of 1B+ to generate 20 GWh for battery.\nTalk about project China 2025 and 2030\nTalk about South Asia countries\nTalk about Central e South America\n\n\n\nValue Chain\n\nRedefined value, create new experiences and perception of benefit For example the value I got from this new electric vehicle.\nBusiness systems that could deliver more of that value than competitors.\nRaised customers’s expectations beyound the competition’s reach.

These aspects suggest that individuals with higher financial literacy are likely to have better financial planning and a stronger sense of financial security. These attributes could be crucial during job loss, providing a cushion to navigate the period of unemployment and explore new career options.\nInformed Decision-making: Financial education can lead to smarter financial decisions. This suggests that financially literate individuals might be better equipped to assess their financial situations, explore different career paths, and make informed decisions regarding retraining or relocation, which are often necessary during career transitions.\nAdaptability and resilience: The sources on advanced manufacturing highlight the importance of adaptability and resilience for workers in the face of rapid techological advancedments and evolving job markets. Financial literacy, could be enhanced by a strong understanding of personal finances. For exemple, a financially literate worker may be more likely to sabe for unexpected events, invest in their own training and development, or take calculated risks to pursue new opportunities, making them more adaptable to changing circunstances.\n\nResearchs\n\nThe role of financial literacy in career transitions: Studies the specifically examine how financial literacy affects workes ability to cope with job loss, retrain for new careers, and achieve financial stability after job displacement would be beneficial.\nFinacial well-being and resilience in deindustrialized communities: Research focusing on the financial outcomes and coping mechaninsms of individuals and families in areas affected by factory closures, ad how financial literacy plays a role, coudl offer valuable insights\nThe intersection of financial liberacy, workforce development, and economic policy: Analyzing how policy initiatives can integrate financial literacy training into brader workforce development programs, particularly for industries undergoing significant change, could provide relevant information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAnjos, Marcelo Carvalho dos. 2024.

    "text": "Lean Six Sigma\nWhat is it?\n\nThere are 17 classes with an introduction to lean principles and six sigma methods, published by MIT and presented by professors Earll Murman, Hugh McManus, Annalisa Weigel and Bo Madsen.\nBook that may be useful: Kaizen Express: Fundamentals for Your Lean Journey\n\nSummary\n\nOverview about patterns and characteristics such as productivity, quality defects, training hours between North American and Japanese manufacturing in 1990.\nLean thinking is dynamic, knowledge-driven, and customer focused process through which all people in a defined enterprise continuously eliminate waste and create value.\nLean focused on reduce waste and six sigma focused on reduced waste. Enterprises usually adopt thei own name (e.g Pratt & Whitney - ACE, US air Force - AFS021, Boeig - Lean+ , New York City Health & Hospitals Corp - Breakthrough)\nCost price relationship\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of Cost price relationship - adapted from MIT lectures\n\n\n\nElements of a process, process map, value in a process, five fundamental lean principles, concepts and tools for implementing lean principles.\n\nProcess is a series of actions, changes, or functions which transform inputs to outputs.\nCustomers also drive the inputs to a process through their needs and requirements.\nProcess mapping is a graphical representation of an idea or steps using texts, illustrations, ideograms or greometric figures. The idea is to provide a clear vision of the whole thing, the flow of elements in the drawing, and the direction they go Anjos (2024)\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of a mapping process for opening stores at Portobello\n\n\n\nTypes of value in process steps.\n\nValue added process steps\nNecessary waste process steps\nPure waste process steps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefining value in a process step - research and evidence-based approach\n\n\n\nIt requires meticulous and systematic study of cause-and-effect relationship to prevent palliative decisions from resulting in adverse outcomes, which can consume a large amout of resources(e.g. time, money) in the reorganization. An illustration that helps to clarify this idea is the Large Blue Butterfly case in southern England. Recent discoveries have identified a positive correlation between the success of the conservation of Large Blue Butterfly, but also of conservation of Myrmica ants and thyme plants. The ants brig the thyme seeds to the nest along with the butterfly larvae. Because they are physically and chemically similar to myrmica ants in their larval stage and use mimicry, the Phengaris Caterpillars(Large Butterfly larva) deceive the ants using the cuckoo strategy Brood parasitism (2024), preying on the ant larvae or begging for food just like a real ant larva. These cause-and-effect relationship were not known in the 1970s, when some countries, in order to solve a problem of overpopulation of rabbits that were destroying crops, took measures by reducing the rabbit population, which, among other things, kept the grass short. From then on, the grass grew quickly cooling the soil, making it an unfavorable environment for the ant, forcing out the ant and depriving the butterfly of the host it depended on, disrupting the process and extinguishing the Large Blue Butterfly that required 40 years of intense scientific research and work to reorganize the system Yong (2009). The data also ruled out a popular theory at the time, that butterfly collectors were responsible for the large blue’s disappearance. The measures that were taken to keep the collectors away made the situation even worse, as the fances erected to keep them away also kept away grazing animals, further accelerating the growth of grass and the rapid extinction of the large blue.\nProfessor Earll Murman at MIT OpenCourseWare (2014) compares the hours of training in the industry in Japan(380.3) to the United States(46.4). The value of training is difficult to measure in the short term, but studies such as the Ebbinghaus fogetting curve could provide relevant information for understanding the cause-and-effect relationships between consistent training and long-term expertise.\n\n\n\nStrategy-driven processes\n\n\n\n\nProcess model guided by strategic goals\n\n\n\nGenchi genbutsu principles, relying on data and observations produced by others does not give a complete understanding.\n\nGo to the actual place\nTalk to the actual people\nDoing the actual work\n\nWhy mapping process is important?\n\n\n\n\nProcess design throughout the business life cycle\n\n\nSorce: MIT by Earll Murman, Hugh McManus, Annalisa Weigel and Bo Madsen\n\n\nInnovation Systems\nWhat is it ?\n\nThere are 20 classes with an introduction to Innovation Systems for Science, Technology, Energy, Manufacturing, and Health, published by MIT and presented by professor William Bonvillian.\n\nSummary\n\nInnovation: Railroad, telegraph, electricity, quality manufacturing, Internet 2000, Energy systems.\n\nImportant factors\n\nSolow MIT: You got to do R&D to achieve technological innovation\nPaul Romer Stanford: Human capital engaged in research (talent base) to drive economic growth.\nDale Jorgenson Harvard: Core technology + deflationary factor driven the economic growth and innovation.\nMerryl Linch: Venture capital.

This includes $39 billion in manufacturing incentives Hawkins (2024)\nIntel has been awarded $8.5 billion in grants and $11 billion on loan guarantees for new chip fab construction under the CHPS Act acording to Manufacturing@MIT (2024). Pat Gelsinger CEO of the company is in 3 years into a turn-around strategy to get back to advanced chip production leadership, and argued the cutbacks were necessary to generate funding for his strategy of building a foundry business to achieve 5 nodes in 4 years. Bad decisions are made along the way such as make gpu chips for AI, adopting advanced lithography, and expand beyond its very profitable x86-based desktop and server chip business. Similar decisions were made at GE, and were reversed by Larry Culp. What lessons could he provide?\n\n\n\nBattery\n\nAcording to Manufacturing@MIT (2024), lithium-ion betteries were invented in United States, but never built the needed supply chains, government support was missing, and batteries faced political and industrial opposition.\nChina that has seized the lead in battery technology, leading battery manufacturing, and making technical progress.

By providing access to cutting-edge hardware, these kits empower people from diverse backgrounds to angage in hands-on experimentation and prototyping Breaking Taps (2024). This, in turn, enables the rapid iteration and refinement of design concepts, accelerating the journey from idea to reality. As a result, dev kits have become an essential tool for driving innovation, fueling breakthroughs, and pushing the boundaries of what is possIble while creating an environment for exapanding supply chain capabilities and knowledge base lgarlati and Gonzalez (2024)\n\n\n\nPharmaceutical\n\nSolid dosage products still account for the majority of medicinal products made worldwide, but there are some hurdles to overcome in order to make the tablet of the future. Issues such as patient centricity, solubility, bioavailability conversion of parental products to solid dosage forms are all topics that need to be addressed.\nQuality, variability, new processes, supply chain, and inspection\nSmart pill such as electronic capsule for tageting drug to delivery system.\n\n\n\nAviation and Jet Egines\n\nJet engine is important part of commerial airplane and reparing them has become a $58 billion business acording to @cnbc2024. A commercial jet engine is a complex, expensive machine made up of thousands of parts and cost of $10 million each one or $6 million for overhaul. The process of overhauling one means disassembling it and replacing all the worn on damaged parts like blades, which can cost up to $20.000 a piece and HPT( high pressure turbine) costing more then $30.000 a piece, and one engine aproximately 40 to 60 of them is necessary. Before the supply chain issues, a typical narrowbody engine took 60 to 75 days to overhaul, and that time has gone up, in some cases to over 200 days because it’s not sufficient spare parts, labor to do this in normal time.\nJet engine manufacturing is dominated by GE Aerospace(12.81%), CFM/Safran(44.77%), Rools-Royce(19.57%) and Pratt & Whitney (22.85%). More than 70% of GE’s commercial engine revenue comes from partes and service, and first two quarters of 2024 GE reported over $15 billion in MRO(maintenance, repair and overhaul) versus $8 billion for new engines.\n\n\n\nCode\n#get stock retursn for GE, RYCEY, SAF.PA, RTX, AIR.PA, BA\n\n\n\nIn U.S. there are over three thousand aircraft repair shops, and the most commonly flown jet engine is CFM56 that 80 to 85% part commonality between engines resulting in a very good reuse capability. The engine has parts which are life time limited and the safe operation of the engine is guaranteed up to 25 to 30 thousand cycles. In the hottest part of a jet engine in 2024, the temperature surrounding the turbine blade is several hundred degrees above the melting point of the material of the turbine blade. Aproximately 1200 parts per engine and many stages for overhauling.\n\nBreak the major flange and then it’ll be separated into the cold and the hot section.\nBroken down into piece and then the parts are cleaned and inspected.\nTesting process envolve techniques such as ultrasound, x-ray, magnetic inspection and fluorescent penetrant that is spray parts with a lime green fluorescent penetrant, and it seeps into the surface of the parts and any subsurface defects. They use a black light for the fluorescent to be little more brilliant and help signify where some of those defects are located Hradecky (2011).\n\nSupply chain issues are expected to persist in an a airline manufacturing and MRO shops raising concerns about rising maintenance costs.\n\n\n\n\nSmartphone\nIn 1990, the United States used to be a global leader in manufacturing, but in 2010, China passed the U.S. going from 3.5% in 1990 to 30.5% in 2021.\nApple and Alphabet hire and send thousands of employees abroad to eversea manufacturing. It was common to send 20,40 engineers at a time to the factory to support prototyping builds to do that learning and finding and fixing of issues and be in the right place at the right time. Apple buying 50 business class seats from San Francisco to Shanghai daily, accounting for $150 million in annual revenue for United Air Lines.\n\nThe popular conception is that companies come to China because of low labor cost. I’m not sure what part of China they go to, but the truth is China stopped being the low labor cost country many years ago and that is not the reason to come to China from a supply point of view. The reason is because of the skill and the quantity of skill in one location and the type of skill it is.\n— Tim Cook - CEO of Apple\n\nAcording to Helwig and Goldman (2024) , manufacturing is subject to learning effect and making high value-added technology products requires specialized process knowledge and when firms or nations stop producing something, developing that capability again is an uphill battle.\nManufacturing process demand a lot of skill and a lot of local supply chain for where all the parts are going to come from to build such a complex product that makes it a very appealing place to build.\nAll products of Apple are designed and engineered in US and they all include components manufactured in U.S. (e.g. iPhone glass is made in Kentucky, and lasers that enable Face ID are built in the U.S. too.). In 2023 Apple annouced $430 billion in new investments across the country, including work with more than nine thousand suppliers across all fifty states in U.S. acording CNBC (2022)\n\nsource: Steve Jobs at MIT 1992\nsource: r’\n\nIn 2012 Google buy Motorola for $12.5 billion and open smartphone manufacturing plant in Fort Worth Texas to build Moto X. The goals was build as American made low cost smartphone but about a year after it opened, the plant shut down, citing high demestic operating costs and low consumer demand. Google sold Motorola to Lenovo for a multibillion dollar loss. Some experts says the U.S. failure shows that the cost of labor and the lack of skill in the U.S. is why manufacturing in the country is not cost effective.\nFoxconn is Apple’s largest supplier and the world’s largest electronic manufacturer. Acording to Yeung (2022) Chairman Terry Gou sayd the core skills and the capabilities of making phones, manufacturing, electronics have moved to Asia and for it to come to America it would be difficult, though not impossible. In 2017, the White House announced Foxconn’s plan to invest $10 billion, and open a massive LCD screen manufacturing facility in Wisconsin creating a 13.000 jobs.\nA smartphone made in America cost $2.000 dollars but the same product made in China cost $1.300, it’s $700 cheaper than the American-made model. The supply chain doesn’t exist. Labor intensive positions is a challange and needs to rebuild.\n\nI worked and managed manufacturing electronics and semiconductors for 30 years. I’ve visited China on manufacturing activities multiple times. I became management and can see the financial statements. In the 1990’s and early 2000’s, labor cost in Asia was the driver. This drove supply chain to go to Asia, even the most complex manufacturing and less labor intensive like chip manufacturing. So in 2000’s it’s supply chain as driver. In the end, it’s profit margin that is driving the companies to manufacture in Asia, particularly China. The US and Europe have given up even their low labor intensive manufacturing capability (chip foundries) and even design capability (engineers are cheaper in Asia). They could still make a profit by manufacturing in the US, but that profit may be only 10% compared to 30% if made in Asia (mostly China). So the root cause is profit MARGIN, not profit.\nFor Beginners and Beyound channel at YouTube\n\n\n\nAutomotive\nTesla Manufacturing by Munro Live and Lars Moravy\nTour of the Giga Factory in Austin Texas by Lars Moravy and Sandy Munro Munro Live (2023) and show how to build the panels for the Tesla Cybertruck.

So we got to be careful when we put it down that we’re not rubbing it againt each other.\nStorage parts: Different blanks all within accuracy tailgate, face hood, doors\nMeasurement system: Basically we have a periodic quality check, take the part put it on a 2d light scanner machine (giant optical comparator) that compare the cut the we’re cutting to in relation to what we’re actually measuring. The results is a level of micron precision that it’s very important for the Elon perspective (japanese uniformity cpk 1.67/2.00). Below is the attention mentioned by the engineer. I also made a graph using the R programing language to illustrate the idea of uniformity Kume (1987)\n\n\n\nWe got to be careful because we’re doing periodic checks to be to make sure this machine has a good CP or CPK or repeatability as what we call it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggQC)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\n#plot a data\nset.seed(1221)\ndata_norm_dist &lt;- \n  data.frame(process_id = 1:1000,\n             sub_group = rep(1:20, each = 5),\n             process_value = rnorm(n = 1000, mean = 10, sd = .5))\n\n#Capability plot\na &lt;- data_norm_dist %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = process_value ))+\n  geom_histogram(bins = 30)+\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(process_value)),\n             linetype = \"dashed\")+\n  stat_QC_Capability(LSL = 8,\n                     USL = 12,\n                     show.cap.summary = c(\"Cp\",\"Cpk\"),\n                     cap.summary.size = 3,\n                     method = \"XmR\")+\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(.15,.6)))+\n  labs(subtitle = \"Maintenace of the present state is all that is needed\",\n       x = \"\")\n\n\n#plot b data\nset.seed(1230)\ndata_dist_lim &lt;- \n  data.frame(process_id = 1:1000,\n             sub_group = rep(1:20, each = 5),\n             process_value = rnorm(1000,10,.5658713))\n\nb &lt;- \n  data_dist_lim %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = process_value))+\n  geom_histogram(bins=30)+\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(process_value)),\n             linetype = \"dashed\")+\n  stat_QC_Capability(LSL = 8,\n                     USL = 12,\n                     show.cap.summary = c(\"Cp\",\"Cpk\"),\n                     cap.summary.size = 3,\n                     method = \"XmR\")+\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = expand_scale(mult = c(.15,1)))+\n  labs(subtitle = \"The spec is satisfied, but there is no extra margin\",\n       x = \"\")\n\n#plot c data\nset.seed(1223)\ndata_dist_out &lt;- \n  data.frame(process_id = 1:1000,\n             sub_group = rep(1:20, each = 5),\n             process_value = rnorm(1000,8.9,.5))\n\nc &lt;- \n  data_dist_out |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = process_value))+\n  geom_histogram(bins = 30)+\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(process_value)),\n             linetype = \"dashed\")+\n  stat_QC_Capability(LSL = 8,\n                     USL = 12,\n                     show.cap.summary = c(\"Cp\",\"Cpk\"),\n                     cap.summary.size = 3,\n                     method = \"XmR\"\n  )+\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = expand_scale(mult = c(.15,.6)))+\n  labs(subtitle = \"It is necessary to take measures to bring the mean closer to the middle\",\n       x = \"\")\n\n#plot d data\nset.seed(1224)\ndata_dist_amp &lt;- \n  data.frame(process_id = 1:1000,\n             sub_group = rep(1:20, each = 5),\n             process_value = rnorm(1000,10,2))\nd &lt;- \n  data_dist_amp %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = process_value))+\n  geom_histogram(bins = 30)+\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(process_value)),\n             linetype = \"dashed\")+\n  stat_QC_Capability(LSL = 8,\n                     USL = 12,\n                     show.cap.summary = c(\"Cp\",\"Cpk\"),\n                     cap.summary.size = 3,\n                     method =\"XmR\")+\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = expand_scale(mult = c(.15,.6)))+\n  labs(subtitle = \"This requires action to reduce the variation\",\n       x = \"\")\n\n#show all plots\n#a + b + c + d + plot_annotation(tag_levels = \"A\", tag_prefix = \"Plot:\")\na + b + c + d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRobotics\nGeneral idea\n\nRobots becoming increasingly prevalent in almost every industry, from healthcare and manufacturing to defense and education.\n\nWelding\nTeaching\nAssemling cars\nPerforming surgery\n\n\n\nRobots Manufacturing\n\nKuka Augsburg, Germany: Industrial robots and factory automation systems.
