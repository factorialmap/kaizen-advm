At today’s meeting, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4.25-4.50 percent.\nLooking ahead, the new Administration is in the process of implementing significant policy changes in four distinct areas:trade, immigration, fiscal policy, and regulation. It is net effect of these policy changes that will matter for the economy and for the path of monetary policy. While there have been recent developments in some of these areas, especially trade policy, uncertainty around the changes and their effects on the economic outlook is high. As we parse the incoming information, we are focused on separating the signal from the nouse as the outlook evolves.\nAs we say in our statement, in considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess incoming data, the evolving outlook,and the balance of risks. We do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance, and we are well positioned to wait for greater clarity.\n— Jerome Powell, March 19, 2025.\n\n\nThere was a signal in the Jackson Hole’s speech, which marked the end of the four-year cycle of increase in the interest rates by the FED.\nThe new cycle attempts to normalize economy, including indicators like the U.S. interest rate curve, according to the averages of the last hundred years.\nThe decision demonstrates FED’s concern for the lower end of the labor market, while de high end is still very tight.\n\n\nNormality is a positively sloped yield curve and we think the terminal rate in FED funds is 3%. Where should 10 years be if we’re at 3%? We should at least be 100 to 150 basis point positively sloped.\n— Gary Cohn, VP of IBM\n\n\nSome indicators that may be evaluated during 2025 are:\n\nOil.\nCommodities.\nShelter (new tenant rents vs old tenant rents).\n\n\nChair Powell on a question from Elizabeth Schulze of ABC News(December meeting, 2024). Why do you think it is that inflation is proving to be more stubborn than you’d expected?\n\nI think people are feeling right now is the effect of high prices, not high inflation. So we understand very well that prices went up by a great deal and people really feel that. And it’s prices of food and transportation, and heating your home, and things like that, so there’s tremendous pain in that burst of inflation that was very global. This was everywhere in all the advanced economies at the same time. So now we have inflation itself is way down but people are still feeling high prices and that is really what people are feeling. The best we can do for them, and that’s who we work for, is to get inflation back down to its target and keep it there so that people are earning big, real wage increase so that their wages are going up, their compensation is going up faster than inflation year upon year upon year, and that’s what will restore people’s good feeling about the economy.\nThat’s what it will take, and that’s what we’re aiming for.\n— Jerome Powell, December meeting 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast update: January, 2025.

Generally, in these cycles, highly leveraged companies tend to file for bankruptcy which are important to observe, mainly due to volatility. The perception of high interest rates and monetary tightening make it difficult to pass on prices to the consumer, leading business to adjust their processes striving for efficiency. Other behaviors:\n\nTemporary rise in unemployment rates, however without sudden moviments. The job losses begin at the lowest rungs in terms of skills, educational attainment, income making capacity. This indicators are being closely monitored by FED officials and the signals can be seen in Mr. Powell’s statements.\nDecisions by companies towards reducing costs(COGS) and operating expenses(SG&A).\nTemporary increase in the cost of capital for privet debt.\nSupply chain reorganization.\n\n\n\nAgroindustry\n\n2023 was an incredible year for agriculture, with high productivity for wheat and corn. In 2024, the harvest is a little late(e.g South Dakota area). There was high intensity of rainfall at the beginning of planting with mild temperatutes, causing the crop not to develop as much as in 2023. During the wheat harvest, usually in August, the corn needs more rain to fill the grain, but this year there was not so much during this period.\nThe distortions generated during the pandemic is make 2024 a year of adjusments that are being faced by growers, agricultural auto manufacturing, and machinery and equipment sales, temporarily affeting jobs.\nLooking for agricultural prices, they are still not good. The expectation is not for a bad year, but it will not be as good as 2023. Sales of new equipment have fallen, making it necessary to adjust costs and expenses in companies such as John Deer and CNH industrial.\n\n\n\nAutomotive\n\nThe automotive industry faces many challenges in 2024. Slowing growth, increased competition, supply chain disruptions generated during the pandemic and business decisions caused distortions in costs and prices that grew way above the population’s income and general inflation rates. This process may take a few years to stabilize.\nThe volume of new car sales does not follow the same trend as population growth. It requires a deeper analysis to identify cause-and-effect relationships, but for now, the hypotheses raised are accessibility and the durability of the vehicles acording to Autoline Network (2024).\n\nFrom a price perspective, historically, it takes 25 weeks of average household income to buy a new vehicle. The average household income in 2024 is $75.000 ($1.400 per week) which would be enough to buy a vehicle worth $36.000 dollars.\nThe age of the vehicles on the road in the United States is 12.6 years acording to Parekh and Campau (2024)\nThe average cost of car ownership in 2024 was around $12,000 annually according to BLS (vehicle purchase 46%, fuels 22%, finance charges 3%, repairs 8%, insurance 15%, others 6%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancial data from auto industry in the second quarter of 2024.\n\n\n\n\nAuto sales by brand 2Q24\n\n\n\nReducing costs and prices, increasing household income, and finding more sources of revenue such as subscription services are some options that can be observed in the market.\nSome car manufacturers are discovering and applying new materials that that awaken the perception of confort and refinement in consumers and this has been reflected in their choices.\n\n\n\nTransportation\nThere was overcapacity in carrier population during the period from 2020 to 2023 due to demand that has been inconsistent over time and is currently undergoing adjustments.

    "text": "PDCA Method and Quality Tools in Manufacturing\nLean Principles\n\nThe basic idea of Lean principles is to focus on the customer value that requires a smooth flow in production and elimination of waste during the value-adding process. The quality is built into every step (e.g design, engineering, production, shipping) making it more adaptable to changing environment, and improvement is driven by workers. One example of value is how much the customer is willing to pay for something.\nValue-added activity: transforms or shape materials, and the customer wants it\nNon-value added activity necessary waste: No value is created, but cannot be eliminated based on current technology, policy or thinking for example regulatory procedures, inspections, invoices etc.\nNon-value added activity pure waste: No value is created and consumes resources for example inventory, rework, excess steps and checks, accidents, scraps, waiting times.\n\n\nBackgroundGenshi genbutsuActionBasic Stability1Basic Stability2Basic Stability3Process mappingMudaTraining1Training2\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of waste\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGemba Walk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFive S\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Stability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Variability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Control\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValue Stream Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of muda\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nArtificial Intelligence is a set of powerful general-purpose tools. Some of these tools include machine learning models used in prediction and recomendation, large language models that enhance knowledge dissemination and task automation, computer vision that allows the capture, processing, and action of manufacturing processes, digital twins that allow the simulation of virtual environments with real-time data, and autonomous agents that can perform tasks in productions. For this to work, elements are needed such as labeled data, synthetic data, sensors, variation control, optimizations, engineering, desing, and a multitude of other components that are developed by humans.\nAs our focus is manufacturing, we continue with the following questions:\n\nHow AI tools (e.g predictive, generative, and agentic models) could support implementation of lean culture in business?\nHow to incorporate lean principles, PDCA method and quality tools into an AI agent and make it useful in solving manufacturing problems?\n\n\n\nRAG Application Pipeline\n\n\n\nPlan-Do-Check-Action- PDCA\n\nThe basic idea of PDCA method is create a universal language to serve as a guide for thinking during the problem-solving process. If language is the vehicle of thought Wittgenstein and Monk (2022), PDCA is a way to make that vehicle faster.\nThe basic idea of the quality tools is reduce waste during performing a value-added task or process, for example time, effort, unnecessary movement etc.\n\n\n\nPDCA (Plan-do-check-action) Method\n\n\n\n\n\nData Science in Manufacturing\n\nBasically data science is solving real problems using data to create as much impact as possible for a business or a system. Impacts can be the form of insights, data products or data recomendations. To do this, data scientists need tools like machine learning models, data visualizations, technical reports, dashboards , and more.\nThe principles of data science involves breaking down complex problems into fundamental truths, gathering data from various sources, identifying and correting errors and inconsistencies to ensure its quality, analyzing data visualy and statistically to uncover patterns and insights, transforming and selecting variables and using techniques such as statistics, programming, and machine learning to build descriptive models that are helpful to descrie or illustrate characteristics of data, inferencial models to produce a decision for a research question or to explore a specific hypothesis, and predictive models to produce the most accurate prediction possible for new data Kuhn and Silge (2022).\nAmong the foundations of data science, two stand out as fundamental:\n\nScientific, which would basically be asking “why” and demanding a rational answer to que question. It requires abilities such as ask insightful questions, active listening, strong orgazational skills, and effective communication of complex ideas in simple terms. As data science often involves sensitive information, understanding ethical considerations and data privacy is critical. This ensures that data is used responsibly and in compliance with regulations.\nTechnical, which would basically the application of technical or scientific knowledge or both to something with a practical purpose. it requires abilities in statistics and probability such as data distributions and statistical tests, programming like Python and R, ability to represent data visually for communicating findings, and machine learning that involves training models to make predictions or decisions based on data.\n\nAs impact of data science on manufacturing we can mention insights into product performance, identify areas for improvement, and develop targeted solutions to reduce warranty claims and improve customer satisfaction. Some examples of practical application are shown below.\n\nIndetify patterns and trends in warranty claims data.\nDevelop predictive models for forecast potential warranty claims.\nAnalyzie the root cause of product defects and develop corrective actions.\nOptimize warranty claims processing and reduce costs.\nStop a machine in an emergency situation, avoiding accidents.\nIdentify fatigue in equipment and workers based on movements patterns.\n\nLooking at the history of use of data in manufacturing processes, we cansay that in the past, manufacturing processes relied heavily on manual labor and basic automation. Data collection was limited and carried out manually through notes, and quality control often involved small sampling. Today, advanced sensors, IoT devices, and AI-driven analytics enable real-time monitoring of production lines, predictive maintenance, and quality control. Machine learing algorithms help in identifying patterns and anomalies, leading to proactive decision-making. Looking forward, autonomous decision-making, adaptive manufacturing systems, and personalized production will coexist. Data integration across supply chains and the adoption of digital twins will enable virtual simulations for testing and optimization before physical production begins. Use of cyber-physical systems will reduce the boundaries between the physical and digital, with smart-manufacturings capable of self-otimization, atomic-level vision capability and real-time response to market demand.\nSome examples os pratical application os data science on manufacturing including:\n\nPredictive Analysis: To monitor businesss operations, performance, and potential solutions to problems impeding future prospects. Machine learning and deep learning are used to predict energy consumption, mechanical properties, and other performance metrics.\nMaintenace: Predict equipment failures, enabling manufacturers to take proactive measures to avoid or mitigate them. By leveraging predictive analytics techniques, manufaturers can identify potential issues before they occur, reducing downtime and increasing overall efficiency. Traditional time-based preventative maintenance strategies can be augmented with data-driven insights, allowing for more informed decision-making and optimized maintenance planning. With careful planning and analysis, equipment manufacturers can schedule maintenance breaks or shutdowns to address potential problems, minimizing delays and failures. This proactive approach helps ensure equipment reliability, reduces maintenance costs and optimizes production output.\nPrice reduction: To optimize their pricing strategies, leading to significant cost reductions. When setting product prices, manufaturers must consider a multitude of factors, including raw material costs, manufacturing expenses, distribution fees, maintenance costs, and more. To strike the perfect balance between profitability and customer affordability, manufacturers leverage price optimization techniques. By analyzing pricing and cost data from both internal and external sources, data science anables manufaturers to gain a competitive edge and develop optimized price variants. This data-driven approach allows manufacturers to identify areas of inefficiency, minimize costs, and maximize revenue, ultimately leading to increased profitability and a stronger market presence. Manufacturers can make informed pricing decisions that drive business growth, improve profitability, ad enhance customer satisfaction.\n\nGain a deeper understanding of their cost structure and identify opportunities for reduction.\nAnalyze market trends and competitor pricing to inform their own pricing strategies.\nAnalyze macro economic trends\nDevelop targeted pricing models that account for variations in customer demand and market conditions.\nOptimize their supply chain and logistics to reduce costs and improve efficiency.\nMonitor and adjust their pricing strategies in real-time to stay ahead of the competition.\n\nSimulations Digital Twin: To simulate and predict the behavior of spaces or manufactured parts under various contiditions, enhancing quality assurance and reducing the need for physical testing Witherell (2024).\n\n\n\nDirecting the Supply Chain: Data science could help manufaturers to navigate risks and uncertainties, providing visibility with the agility they need to respond quickly to changing market conditions and customer needs. Proactively identify potential disruptions, asses their likelihood, and develop strategies to mitigate their impact. Supply chain management requires a deep understanding of the complex variables, including supplier performance, inventory levels, transportation costs, and customer demand. Some examples where data science can be helpful in the supply chain are shown below.\n\nAnalyze real-time data to identify potential bottlenecks and delays.\nAssess the likehood of major disruptions and develop contingency plans.\nEvaluate the performance of suppliers and identify opportunities for improvement.\nOptimize inventory management and reduce waste.\n\nWarranty Analysis: To optimize warranty claims process by analizing data from various sources, including product performance, customer feedback, and warranty claims, manufaturers can identify early warning signs for product failures and take proactive measures to address them. Data scientists can help manufacturers analyze the root causes of product defects, identify patterns and trends, and develop predictive models to forecast potential warranty claims. With the help of AI and warranty analytics, manufacturers can process vast amounts of warranty-related data from multiple sources, including:\n\nProduct sensor data\nCustomer feedback and complaints\nWarranty claims and repair data\nManufacturing and quality control data\n\nProduct Authenticity: Product authenticity is particularly important in the pharmaceutical and food industries, where counterfeit or adulterated products can have serious consequences for public health. Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) is a powerfil analytical technique to help manufacturers to ensuring the authenticity of products across various industries. With the unique spectral signatures of materials, NIRS enables the rapid and non-invasive identification of chemical composition, allowing manufacturers to verify the ahthenticity of their products. The system operates by emitting infrared photons from the light source, which interact with the sample, causing molecular vibrations or stretching within the sample. These interactions result in a spectrum that reflects the properties of the molecules and thei chemical bonds. To extract meaningful information, the spectra undergo specific preprocessing (e.g. PLS,PCA) techniques to eliminate noise and redundat data. Subsequently, these techniques are employed to identify effective wavelengths that precisely classify the product.A well-constructed model can accurately classify the product with minimal error.\n\nExamples of use\n\nVerify the identity of raw materials and finished products.\nDetect adulteration or contamination.\nEnsure compliance with regulatory requirements.\nProtect their brand reputation and intellectual property.\nPrevent financial loesses due to counterfeit products.\n\nCharacteristics of NIRS\n\nFast: NIRS can analyze samples in a matter of second, making it an ideal technique for high-volume production environments.\nCost-effective: Is a relative low-cost technique compared to other analytical methods, making it an attractive option for manufacturers.\nNon-invasive: Is a non-destructive technique, which means that samples remain intact and can be used for further analysis or processing.\n\n\nRobotization and Automation: To perform repetitive, mundane, and hazardous tasks, freeing up human workers to focus on higher-value activities. However, the integration and maintenance of robots can be a significant annual expense for manufaturers. This where data science comes in - by analyzing data from various sources(Exploring more in this topic in the future), manufacturers can optimize robot programming and operation, leading to improved product quality and reduced costs. Some examples of the pratical application of data science in robotis and automation:\n\nAnalyze sensor data from robots to predict and prevent maintenance issues, reducing repair costs and extending equipment lifespan.\nIdentify areas where automation can be improved or expanded, driving further innovation and growth.\nStreamline robot integration and deployment, reducing downtime increasing productivity and availability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nKuhn, Max, and Julia Silge. 2022.

In addition to the main document, I also used reference documents, books, videos and articles to complement this work.\n\nAdvanced Manufacturing\n\nAdvanced manufacturing refers to the use of innovative technology, process and methods like intelligent robotics, additive manufacturing, digital twins, artificial intelligence, and lean principles to accelerate the design and production of physical goods. As a result, it is possible to achieve scale and possibilities that was previously impossible like cost reduction, and value-added products in shorter cycles.\nAdvanced manufacturing combines human capital with automation, robotics, AI(e.g, machine learning, large language models, computer vision, autonomous agents), IoT, and 3D printing to drive innovation and efficiency.\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Manufacturing\n\n\n\n\nImpacts\nAdcanced manufacturing drives economic stability, competitiveness, and growth, while maintaining fundamental skills, and mitigating market risks.

Studying the past helps us identify how experiences shape the history and influence memory formation, and learning.\nProcess Innovation History\n\nShorten the distance: Enhancing the movement of goods to boost trade, industry, agriculture, and communication regionally and across the country. Erie Canal navigable waterway connecting the great lakes to the atlantic ocean completed in 1825 according to DPLA (1821) . The objective was to develop the city of New York, which was a point of communication with the world (e.g. port of trade hub), and opened up the MidWest for settlement and agricultural expansion, impacting the marginal product of labor according to Kaiman, Vandenbroucke, and Wolla (2024). The canal also had profound societal impacts shaping the nation’s economic development in the 19th century:\n\nIt spurred westward migration, enhance commercial trade between regions.\n\nIt contributed to the rise of new towns along its route.\n\nIt facilitated cultural and political unity between the Northest and the expanding western territories.\n\n\n\n\nErie Canal MapErie Canal Impacts\n\n\n\n\n\nErie Canal Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy 1855 cross-state travel went from six weeks to six days, and freight costs fell from $100 to $5 per ton - Old Newarks’ Main Street Bridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew processes: Making better products, faster and cheaper. The idea of the the Bessemer process was observed and described by a german adventurer Johan Mandelsio in 1669 during a trip to Japan, was patented by Henry Bessemer in 1855 in U.S., and popularized by visionary and entrepreneur Andrew Carnegie in 1870s, which allowed the creation of time machines like bridges, ships, trains, elevators, oil and water pipes, and vertical buldings. This process cuts the manufacturing time of single steel rail from two weeks to fifteen minutes.\nKnowledge base, science, and data: Improvements of efficiency in the petroleum refining process using scientific methods, commercial partnerships, product standardization and uniformity. These factors enhanced Rockefeller’s natural leadership capabilities.\nRedefine customer values: Ford, Packard, Home Depot, Nike, Dell Computer, Apple, Netflix and Tesla are just a few examples of how they created new damand by delivering a previously unknown experience to consumers. They built powerful, cohesive business systems that could deliver more of this value than their competitors. They raised customer expectations beyond what their competitors could reach.\nLow levels of stress and anxiety: There is a potential association between consistently low levels of stress and anxiety (particularly when individuals or organizations remain in their confort zones) and a loss of economic competitiveness. While confort zone is beneficial for maintaining mental and physical health, can also lead to complacency. Moderate stressors encourage problem-solving, innovation, and adoption of new technologies. In the long term a lack of challenge and growth opportunities can lead to decreased motivation and creativity. Stress is a know driver of cognitive adaptation which is crucial for maintaining productivity in dynamic economic environments. This type of behavior and its consequences could be observed in the 1980s in the United States JustARandomChannel (2019) Peter Santenello (2024) FRONTLINE PBS (2024) and currently in 2024 in Germany DW News (2024).\nProcess improvement: Founded in 1906 by Willlian Riley, New Balance is an American footwear and apperal company headquartered in Boston Massachusetts, and one of the world leading manufacturers of high-quality athletic footwear. Known for its “Made in USA” products, the company prides itself on innovation, and performance using lean principles and tools to improve product flow through its plants to retailers and final customers.\nThe company began its lean transformation journey in 2003, with guidance from the Toyota Supplier Support Center, New Balance focused in problem-solving and process improvement to create a culture engaging the workforce while boosting performance.\nLean as management philosophy and set of practices aimed at creating more value for customers with less waste by continuously improving processes and eliminating non-value-adding activities. Deep understand of the value creation process, continuous learning through PDCA cycles, and willingness to challenge assumtions are vital for both workers and managers.\nProblem-Solving Culture Employees identufy and tackle problems, with regular meetings to discuss and implement solutions. Instead of giving orders and say do that do this do this, they say, Okay, here’s the problem, here’s the gap that wr are trying to close, what are you going to do, how can I help? Start with a custmer, go backwards, and say, “Well, now hat are your problems?”.\nLean Education Associates receive training on lean priciples, including workshops on the basics of lean and waste detection. We have gone from the great manager solves problems to the coach helps people learn how to solve problems.\nStandardized Work Processes are standardized to ensure efficiency and quality.\nContinuous improvement Employees are encouraged to submit improvement ideas, with recognition and rewards for successful implementatios. Lean enterprises need to grow to provide apportunities for their employess and increase value creation. By cosntantly improving and becoming more efficient, theu can remain competitive and secure the jobs of their workforce Murman (2008)\n\n\n\nThe Present\nFocusing on the present helps us undertand how we process information in real time, essential for responding to stimuli quickly and performing daily activities with mindfulness. One of the challenges of staying focused on the present is dealing with digital and physical distractions that are present in abundant quantities.\nChallenges\n\nDisruptive technologies: New ideas and old ones that could be explored by integration with emerging technology like computational capability, genAI, and atomic computer vision.\n\nDemographic shifts around the world: People are getting older and more urban. Below is an example of the demographic transition in some countries where:\n\nP pencentage of the population in each group\nT total population in million in each group\nAS number of Adults to each Senior (65+ years)\nAY number of Adults to each Young (0-19 years)\n\n\n\n\nIndiaChinaIndonesiaUnited StatesBrazilJapanGermany\n\n\n\n\n\nDemographic transition - India\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemographic transition - China\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemographic transition - Indonesia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemographic transition - USA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemographic transition - Brazil\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemographic transition - Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemographic transition - Germany\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEconomic activities in emerging markets: Many countries are emerging from poverty, creating opportunities and threats for example new demands, and lower labor costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nPCA: Principal Component Analysis between countries\n\n\n\nClimate change: New rules to take care of the environment, improving the capacity to adapt and interact with the environment by creating new products and services.\n\n\n\n\n\nElectricity consumption by country\n\n\n\nErosion fo U.S. industrial capacity: Over the past few decades, the U.S. has experienced a significant decline in its industrial capacity. In 1980, the U.S. manufactured over 40 percent of global high-technology goods, facing 18 percent today. This decline poses a threat to both economic competitiveness and national security.\n\nPRC’s Dominance: China has emerged as a potential competitor, cultivation substantial high-tech industrial production capacity and accounting for nearly 30 percent of global manufacturing output. China has strategically prioritized advanced manufacturing as a cornestone of its national rejuvenation strategy.\n\nSkills Gap and Workforce Shortages: Outsourcing production has led to a skills gap in the U.S. workforce. This is compounded by a persistent labor shortage in the manufacturing sector, with a projected shortfall of 2.1 million unfilled jobs by 2030. This shortage hinders the adoption and implementation of advanced manufacturing technologies.\n\nSmall and Medium Manufacturing Adoption Barriers: Small and medium-sized manufacturers contribute the majority of the U.S. manufacturing ecosystem and they face significant obstacles in adopting advanced manufacturing technologies. These include a lacka of access to capital, expertise, and resources for system upgrades and integration.\n\nUnderinvestment in R&D: The U.S. lag as behind other advanced economies in terms of manufacturing-related R&D spending as a percentage of GDP. This underinvestment hampers innovation and the development of cutting-edge manufacturing processes.\n\nNeed the key actors working together: Industry, universities and governments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpportunities\n\nReconceptualize the workforce: The changing nature of manufacturing requires a new approach to workforce development, with a focus on training “technologists” skilled in both engineering and operation of advanced machinery.\n\nLeverage existing programs: The United States can build upon succesful programs like the manufacturing USA program and the Manufacturing Externsion Partnetship(MEP) to accelerate workforce development initiatives.\nFocus on cyber skills: The increasing integration of digital technologies in manufacturing requires a workforce with strong cyber skills.\nDevelop a national talent marketplace: A centralized platform connecting job seekers with advanced manufacturing opportunities can help to adress workforce shortages.\nLeveraging U.S. Strenths in AI and Software: The U.S. enjoys a significant lead in generative AI, a technology with the potential to transform various facets of advanced manufacturing (e.g.GenAI can creates copilots to helps workers interpret complex factory data and enhance AI-driven design tools that can create product designs from natural language descriptions)\nRebuilding Domestic Production Capacity:\nPublic and Private Investments:\nCollaboration with Allies and Partners:\nReshoring and Scaling Up Production:\n\nIndustrial Policy for Process Innovation and Recent Development in U.S.\n\nCHIPS Act: The U.S.manufacturing share of GDP down 16% since 2012, share of semiconductor production declined from 37% in 1990 to 12% in 2022, and produced no cutting-edge advanced chips. Also, $205B trade deficit in advanced tech products, and the Hamilton Index R. D. Atkinson (2022) showing gaps with comparison to another countries. To reduce theses gaps, U.S. Congress passed Chips Act to incentivize U.S. and allied country firms to build or expand advanced-industry R&D and production sites in the United States. The focus on quantum computing, robotics, 6G equipments, gene edititing, high bandwidth memory chips, chipmaking equipment and software to develop advanced AI systems to improve manufacturing capabilities. Not only invent in U.S. but manufacture in U.S.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScience: The basic idea was to identify 10 strategic tecnologies like quantum autonomous systems, AI, biotech, etc. and then give funding to National Science Fundation but for slightly later TRL research more focus on commercialization and partnership with industry.\nRegional Innovation Hubs: Program that recognized that almost all of the really advanced innovation and job growth was in five methopolitan areas in the U.S. (Silicon Valleym, Boston, Seattle) and that there was this big regional gap in the heartland if you will so this\nRelated Manufacturing: The manufacturing extension partnership at the National Institute of Standards and Technology it’s basically extension services for SMMs(Small and medium-sized manufacturers).\nIRA(Inflation reduction Act): During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the U.S. has experienced 40-year record-high inflation that has just now started to cool down over the past serveral months. Inflation Reduction Act was sined into law in 2022. Key provisions of the bill are directly aimed at improving the lives of the American middle class and easing financial burdens in a post-pandemic economy. This includes up to $600 per year toward energy-efficient skylights, and up to $500 per year for two doors.\n\nEstablish an economic initiative commiting the U.S. to increase its relative level of advanced-industry concentration by 20% poonts in a decade.\nAccording to Atkinson (2024) , Assuming a 3% growth rate in the rest of the economy, doing so could add nearly $2.5T to advanced-industry output over 10 years. It would also reduce U.S. supply chain vulnerability, create millions of good jobs, could adjust imbalances in home prices, reduce trade deficit, waken China’s advanced economy, and shore up dual-use industries critical to U.S. National Defense.\nAccording to Bonvillian (2024) , different approaches were applied such as top down, bottom up, direct production support, demonstration projects, supply chain support, and regional implementation. The impact can be seen in the chart below (Overall U.S. Manufacturing construction), and also in the growth of investment in machinery and equipment(by brekdown of GDP).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Future\nStudying the future to understand decision-making processes, planning, and expectation building, which are crucial for strategic goals. Anticipating future scenarios helps analyze consequences and risks, leading to more effective and safer decisions. The challenges is to control anxiety especially in very optimistic or pessimistic projections.\nProcess Innovation of the future\n\nShorten the distance Improving the flow of traded goods transforming trade, industry, agriculture, and communication in the region and across the country.\n\nReturning supersonic trips more affordable for passengers, profitable for companies, cleaner, quieter, and dramatically more fuel efficient. Speed of sound making the world feel smaller for example Tokio-Seattle in 4.4 hours, New York to London in 3.4 hours. The overture synphony engine runs with a 100% sustainable aviation fuel making supersonic flights more efficient than subsonic flights in terms of carbon emissions.\nSatelite high speed internet communication More information, education,\nHyperloop is a technology has the potential to offering faster, more efficient, and sustainable logistics solutions. It can transport cargo at speeds of up to 700 mph, significantly reducing travel times, reducing downtime and incresing overall efficiency. some ot the challenges of this technology today are maintaining a vaccum seal in the tubes, propulsion, and levitation systems. Despite thise challenges, several companies, including HyperloopTT, Hardt B.V., and Transpod, are actively working on developing hyperloop technology for cargo transportation.\n\nNew processes: Making better products, faster and cheaper. (Innovation economic book here, tesla unbox here, example based tactile simulation and sim-to-real applications )\n\nBattery manufacturing process Advancing dry-process battery technology that enable to dry print anodes and varios cathodes(e.g lithium iron phospate-LFP, nickel manganese cobalt-NMC, sodium ion etc) with no metal or liquid inside it, saving weight(23% from today standards), space in the packaging, costs(7% from today standards), more easely to recycling, more safe because no risk of thermal runaway, and 30% more energy density(from today standards 272 Wh/kg).\n\n\n\nSakuú revolutionary dry-electrode printing technology enables more advanced and sustainable battery manufacturing at scale, including elimination of toxic materials and solvents, reduction in cost complexity, and ability to work with a very range of both current and future active materials and battery chemistries. It’s enable battery producers and original equipment manufacturer(OEMs) to successfully meet this incredible surge in demand and do it more sustainably. That’s why we are the world’s first manufacturing platfform for printing battery electrodes?\n\n\n— Mr. Robert Bagheri, founder and CEO of Sakuú\n\n-   **Modular Assembly or Unboxed Manufacturing Process** A modular approach where vehicle sub-assenblies are manufactured independently and connected later. Giga Castings, replacing hundreds of smaller parts with large, single-piece castings simplifies assembly, reduces weight, and improves structural rigidity. Autonomous Production eliminating traditional conveyor belts and exploring autonomous vehicles that move through production areas. Flow chart would go from a linear process flow to a parallel process flow. 30% increase in assembly speed and a 44% increase in worker density requiring a smaller factory, 40% smaller factory footprint leading to lower capital expenditure and 50% reduction in cost of good sold for future vehicles.\n\nKnowledge base, science, and data: (insert Lip-Bu Tan here, What are the limitation of scientists today?What are your questions? Insert the schematic process of the beagle sensors and processing here )\n\nChip manufacturing there a five generations waves happening at the same time including AI Machine learning, Industry 4.0, Autonomous driving, and cloud computing.\nData analysis U.S. have in BLS website which has 400 digitis nakes codes manufacturing sectors with every year like productivity growth, amount of labor, labor cost, capital investment. For example use this data to correlate wage levels to capex. Does Capex correlate to lagged productivity? What sectors doing the most? Today don’t also have any analysis of the causes for example why is our car production sector so weak?\nSmart grids Planning of alternatives, When increasing of distributed generation(pch, biomass, pv, nuclear, hydro, coal, o&g, vehicles) that requires a network that absorbs, knows and receives this data and reacts positively at the same time thatt is has to give a return to those who are offering energy and to those who are investing. Concepts of automation, data science, great possibilities of energy transactions.\nThe ability of EVs to both draw electricity from the grid for charging and supply electricity back to the grid through vehicle-to-grid(V2g) technology has a significant implications for the smart grid system. An example of a practical application of the system would be when a blizzard is forecast. Wheather forecast systems communicate with vehicles requestion maximum battery charging before the storm. This charge could be used during a period of power outages.\n\nReal world example: Denmark’s Edison Project with V2G feasibility with 10 bi-directional EVs, Californica V2G Pilot tested this technology with 50 EVs, Japan’s Chademo Association developed V2G-capable charging standards. Future outlook is increase adoption, advanced technologies(improvements in battery tech, power electronics and cybersecurity), and grid integration(decentralized renewable energy-based smart grid).\nNuclear Fusion Bring electricity to low income countries bringing significant improvement in standard of living.\nSmart cars Communication between them and the system reducing accidents and casualties, saving millions of dollars and thousands of lives.\nSmart tags Solving the problems of lines in the supermarket.\nHigh speed trains Solving problems of wating times and necessity of security checks in the airports.\nSmart robots machine-knitted pressure-sensitive low cost tactile skin that is scalable\nAutonomous truck John Deer CES 2025, save time, reduce risks os crash through drive assistant. 20 years ago we were probably pushing 120 tons an hour, and today we’re mining 350/370 tons an hour. We run 24/7 we run like on a four shift basis the larg of the corry that there’s many new challenges safy, employment and training finding skilled labor is very challenging it to be able to run and see them as machine and be able operate it from my desk will eliminate the training, eliminate safety factors you want everybody to go home safe it’s going to increse productivity out of the mine and give me more time to be more creative of what we need to do in the future.\n\nExample fully autonomous ADT or Dusty manufacture in Devenport Iowa that machine leverages starts with hihg performance eletronics, designed and tested by John Deere for over 30 years to operate in Earth’s toughest environments the ruggedized component stack includes satellite internet advanced controls, starfire gps, 360 view cameras and sensors, and high performance GPU’s which enable us to deliver real autonomy into the and dirty world of construction.\nTechnical training Hands-on practical experience by using virtual reality and advanced training simulators to prepare the workforce for advanced manufacturing jobs (e.g Palette Skils, Advanced Industry Training by Weber State University)\n\nRedefine customer values: Create new damand by delivering a previously unknown experience to consumers. They built powerful, cohesive business systems that could deliver more of this value than their competitors. They raised customer expectations beyond what their competitors could reach. According to Gary Cohn, increase in GDP growth could substantially reduce debt/GDP ratio, which could consequently improve investors’s long-term planning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess improvement: The best possible products at the lowest possible cost, in the most timely manner, on a stable long-term basis.\n\nIntelligent management grid Electric vehicle charging management according to variables such as demand, time, and avaiability. The vehicle would make the decision based on data analysis with focus on system avaiability.\n\n\n\n\nAction Plan\n\nSemiconductors: Chips and Science Act, focus on increasing US competitiveness in the semiconductor industry, incentive for creating research and development centers in semiconductor techonologies.\nEnergy Technologies: Inflation Reduction Act, incentives for the production of electric vehicles, batteries electricity, and tax credits for companies investing in clean technologies.\nTechnology Demonstrations: Infraestructure Act, focus on infrastructure projects that promote innovation and sustainability, incentives for the adoption of clean and efficient techonologies in infrastructure project.\n3-3-3 plan: Involve cutting the budget deficit to 3% of GDP by 2028, boosting GDP growth to 3% through deregulation and other pro-growth policies, and increasing U.S. energy production to the equivalent of an additional 3 million barrels of oil per day.\nWorkforce Education:\nAmbitious of industrialize: Build the factories, Supply chain, and vertically integrate those Supply chains together.\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of processes guided by objectives and strategy\n\n\n\n\nChallenges\n\nLearning by doing: When companies or countries cease production something, it becomes difficult to redevelop that capability. This is due to the speciallized process knowledge required to manufacture high-value-added technology products. Here are some examples of historical process innovations and how they illustrate the importance of learning by doing.\n\nThe Watt Process for power generation from steam: James Watt’s improvements to the steam engine in the 18th centry weren’t solely based on theoretical knowledge. He continuously experimented and refined his designs through practical application, gradually increasing the engine’s efficiency and paving the way for the Industrial Revolution.\nThe Bessemer Process for Steel Production: In the 19th century, Henry Bessemer developed a process for mass-producing steel. This involved blowing air tinto molten iron to remove impurities. While the initial concept was based on scientific principles, the actual implementation required extensive trial and error to perfect. The continuous refinement of the Bessemer process through practical experience led to a significant reduction in steel prices, fueling advancements in construction, transportation, and other industries.\nThe Planar Process for Microelectronics: Developed in the late 1950s, the plannar process revolutionized the manufacturing of transistors and integrated circuits. This method involved building layers of semiconductor material on a flat substrate. While the scientific understanding of semiconductor was essential, mastering the intricate steps of the planar process required practical experience and continuous improvement through learning by doing. This innovation enabled the miniaturization fo electronics and paved the way for the digital innovation wave.\nFordism: Pioneered by Henry Ford in the early 20th century, revolutionized manufacturing through mass production, vertical integration, experimentation and innovation (e.g. introduced the moving assembly line, a radical innovation that significantly accelerated production)\n\n\nTheses cases emphasize that the United States must regain its learning by doing advantage in advanced manufacturing to compete effectively in the global technology landscape.\n\n\nValue Chain\nBusiness Model and Cultural transformation\n\nAcording Treacy and Wiersema (1993) to becoming an industry leader requires to choose a value discipline that takes into account its capabilities and culture as well as competitors’s strengths .\nRedefined value, create new experiences and perception of benefit For example the value I got from this new electric vehicle.\nBusiness systems that could deliver more of that value than competitors.\nRaised customers’s expectations beyound the competition’s reach. Today’s customers have an expanded concept of value that includes convenience of purchase, after-sale service, dependability, and so on.\nHow to deliver superior customer value in line with one of the three value disciplines - operational excellence, customer intimacy or product leadership - in a world where populations are getting older Anjos (2024) , more urban, new tehnologies are emerging rapidly, economic activity in emerging markets is expanding rapidly all this without forgetting climate change ?\n\n\nValue ChainCustomer value\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of value chain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of the idea of value discipline\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is relationship between small manufacturing and advanced manufacturing?

    "text": "Lean Six Sigma\nWhat about this classes ?\n\nThere are 17 classes with an introduction to lean principles and six sigma methods, published by MIT and presented by professors Earll Murman, Hugh McManus, Annalisa Weigel and Bo Madsen.\nBook that may be useful: Kaizen Express: Fundamentals for Your Lean Journey by Toshiko Narusawa and John Shook\nAdditional videos that may be useful: Industry Talks E11: James P. Womack on YouTube\n\nSummary\n\nOverview about productivity, quality defects, and training hours. Differences between North American and Japanese manufacturing in 1990.\nLean thinking, knowledge-driven, and customer focused process through which all people in a defined enterprise continuously eliminate waste and create value. Enterprises usually adopt their own name (e.g GE Aviation - Flight Deck, Pratt & Whitney - ACE, US air Force - AFS021, Boeig - Lean+ , New York City Health & Hospitals Corp - Breakthrough)\nLean thinking is a way of thinking and a set of practices focused o creating more value with less rosources. It involves constantly experimenting and improving to eliminate waste and optimize the entire value stream, from raw materials to the customer.\n\nTypes of value in process steps\n\nValue added process steps: Transform or shape materials\nNecessary waste process steps: Regulatory, project coordinations\nPure waste process steps: Excess moviment, inventory, wait time, rework, confusion(information process).\n\nValue Stream map\nIdentify all the steps involved in delivering value and eliminate non-value-adding activities.\n\nElements of a process, process map, value in a process, five fundamental lean principles, concepts and tools for implementing lean principles.\nProcess is a series of actions, changes, or functions which transform inputs to outputs.\nCustomers also drive the inputs to a process through their needs and requirements.\n\nContinuous flow\n\nFlow: Ensure a smooth and continuous flow of work through the value stream.\nPull: Produce only what is needed, when it is needed.\nPerfection: Continuously strive for perfection by eliminating waste and improving processes.\n\nSocial contract or contancy of purpose\nLean’s succes hinges on a strong social contract between employees and the company, supporting a culture of continuous improvement with the aim to become competitive and to stay in business, and to provide jobs. Workers will only contribute ideas if they feel the arrangement is fair and mutually beneficial. Employees are commited to dedicate themselves to their jobs, while the company is commited to provide opportunities for skill development, enabling employees to defend their jobs.\nHosing Kanri focuses on aligning the entire organization around a few critical strategic objectives. It involves setting clear goals, developing action plans, and monitoring progress towards those goals.\nToyota started in 1935 and they only got their system perfected by the mid-1960s. It took them 25+ years of experiments and they’ve struggled across the world to maintain the standard as they’ve grown.\nShifting from KPIs to Problem-Solving or instead of giving orders and say do that, do this, they say “Okay, here’s the problem, here is the gap that we’re trying to close, what are you going to do, how can I help?” That is a different conversation than “make your numbers”.\nAccording to James P. Womack (2022), reducing inventory should not be the primary focus, but rather a result of improving capability and reducing variability. He emphasizes that simply decreasing inventory reduction without addressing underlying issues will lead to stockouts and dissatisfied customers.\nStandard Inventory\nIn the Lean world, standard inventory is the necessary amout to protect the customer and maintain a smooth production flow that includes:\n\nSafety stock: To buffer againg process incapability\nBuffer stock: To absorb variations in uptream processes\nShipping stock: To accommodate shipping frequency\n\nFocus on Capabilty and Variability\n\nImprove process capability to consistently produce good results, reducing the need for safety stock.\nEmploy Heijunka (production leveling) to smooth demand and minimize buffer stock.\nIncrease shipping frequency to reduce shipping stock.\n\nInventory as a consequence\nWhen capability improves and variability decreases, the need for standard inventory naturally diminishes, leading to lower inventory levels. In a high-interest-rate environment, reducing inventory becomes even more crucial, as excess inventory ties up capital. In world war 2, Toyota focus on minimizing inventory due to the high cost of money in Japan.\nContinuous improvement\nEvolution of Lean Implementation that has shifted from a consultant-driven. “quick-fix” approach to a coaching model that empowers employees to identify and solve problems themselves.

An illustration that helps to clarify this idea is the Large Blue Butterfly case in southern England. Recent discoveries have identified a positive correlation between the success of the conservation of Large Blue Butterfly, but also of conservation of Myrmica ants and thyme plants. The ants brig the thyme seeds to the nest along with the butterfly larvae. Because they are physically and chemically similar to myrmica ants in their larval stage and use mimicry, the Phengaris Caterpillars(Large Butterfly larva) deceive the ants using the cuckoo strategy Brood parasitism (2024), preying on the ant larvae or begging for food just like a real ant larva. These cause-and-effect relationship were not known in the 1970s, when some countries, in order to solve a problem of overpopulation of rabbits that were destroying crops, took measures by reducing the rabbit population, which, among other things, kept the grass short. From then on, the grass grew quickly cooling the soil, making it an unfavorable environment for the ant, forcing out the ant and depriving the butterfly of the host it depended on, disrupting the process and extinguishing the Large Blue Butterfly that required 40 years of intense scientific research and work to reorganize the system Yong (2009). The data also ruled out a popular theory at the time, that butterfly collectors were responsible for the large blue’s disappearance. The measures that were taken to keep the collectors away made the situation even worse, as the fances erected to keep them away also kept away grazing animals, further accelerating the growth of grass and the rapid extinction of the large blue.\nProfessor Earll Murman at MIT OpenCourseWare (2014) compares the hours of training in the industry in Japan(380.3) to the United States(46.4).

This includes $39 billion in manufacturing incentives Hawkins (2024)\nIntel has been awarded $8.5 billion in grants and $11 billion on loan guarantees for new chip fab construction under the CHPS Act acording to Manufacturing@MIT (2024). Pat Gelsinger CEO of the company is in 3 years into a turn-around strategy to get back to advanced chip production leadership, and argued the cutbacks were necessary to generate funding for his strategy of building a foundry business to achieve 5 nodes in 4 years. Bad decisions are made along the way such as make gpu chips for AI, adopting advanced lithography, and expand beyond its very profitable x86-based desktop and server chip business.\n\nIn Dec 2, 2024 CFO David Zinsner and Michelle Holthaus will serve as interim CEOs of Intel while the board searches for a sucessor for Mr. Gelsinger. Chip design involves creating the specifications and architecture of semiconductor chips, while foundries are specialized manufacturing facilities that produce these chips based on the designs provided by companies. Essentially, chip designers focus on the conceptual side, and foundries handle the physical production.\nIn Mar 12, 2024 Intel announced Lip-Bu Tan as a new CEO.\n\nIn Oct, 2025 Wolfspeed received $750 million in grant money from the federal chips act. There is a big transition in products and building a new giant plant for silicon carbide materials in Siler City(Chatham County) and other in Upstate New York. Wolfspeed is also partening with local community colleges to offer courses to people who would want to work at the factory that they called TCP or technician certification progam.\nIn Mar 4, 2025 TSMC announces $100 billion more in Phoenix, AZ manufacture site. At total now of $165 billion investing in more three fullscale fabrication facilities, two new packaging plants, and one R&D center.\n\n\n\nBattery and electricity\n\nAcording to Manufacturing@MIT (2024), lithium-ion betteries were invented in United States, but never built the needed supply chains, government support was missing, and batteries faced political and industrial opposition.\nChina that has seized the lead in battery technology, leading battery manufacturing, and making technical progress.

By providing access to cutting-edge hardware, these kits empower people from diverse backgrounds to angage in hands-on experimentation and prototyping Breaking Taps (2024). This, in turn, enables the rapid iteration and refinement of design concepts, accelerating the journey from idea to reality. As a result, dev kits have become an essential tool for driving innovation, fueling breakthroughs, and pushing the boundaries of what is possIble while creating an environment for exapanding supply chain capabilities and knowledge base lgarlati and Gonzalez (2024)\n\n\n\nPharmaceutical\n\nSolid dosage products still account for the majority of medicinal products made worldwide, but there are some hurdles to overcome in order to make the tablet of the future.

The goals is treatment such as target therapy to be targeting cancer cells only that express some specific proteins that attract the antibody like GPS system process.\n\n\n\nAviation and Jet Egines\n\nJet engine is important part of commerial airplane and reparing them has become a $58 billion business acording to @cnbc2024. A commercial jet engine is a complex, expensive machine made up of thousands of parts and cost of $10 million each one or $6 million for overhaul. The process of overhauling one means disassembling it and replacing all the worn on damaged parts like blades, which can cost up to $20.000 a piece and HPT( high pressure turbine) costing more then $30.000 a piece, and one engine aproximately 40 to 60 of them is necessary. Before the supply chain issues, a typical narrowbody engine took 60 to 75 days to overhaul, and that time has gone up, in some cases to over 200 days because it’s not sufficient spare parts, labor to do this in normal time.\nJet engine manufacturing is dominated by GE Aerospace(12.81%), CFM/Safran(44.77%), Rools-Royce(19.57%) and Pratt & Whitney (22.85%). More than 70% of GE’s commercial engine revenue comes from partes and service, and first two quarters of 2024 GE reported over $15 billion in MRO(maintenance, repair and overhaul) versus $8 billion for new engines.\n\n\nGE Aerospece delivered a strong finish to 2024 given robust demand for our services and products with fourth quarter orders up 48%, EPS more than doubling, and free cash flow increasing over 20%.\nLooking to 2025, we expect double-digit revenue and EPS growth wth greather than 100% free cash flow conversion. Guided by Flight Deck, our proprietary lean operating model, I’m confident in our ability to accelerate output and deliver for our customers\n— Larry Culp - GE Aerospace Chairman and CEO\n\n\nIn U.S. there are over three thousand aircraft repair shops, and the most commonly flown jet engine is CFM56 that 80 to 85% part commonality between engines resulting in a very good reuse capability. The engine has parts which are life time limited and the safe operation of the engine is guaranteed up to 25 to 30 thousand cycles. In the hottest part of a jet engine in 2024, the temperature surrounding the turbine blade is several hundred degrees above the melting point of the material of the turbine blade. Aproximately 1200 parts per engine and many stages for overhauling.\n\nBreak the major flange and then it’ll be separated into the cold and the hot section.\nBroken down into piece and then the parts are cleaned and inspected.\nTesting process envolve techniques such as ultrasound, x-ray, magnetic inspection and fluorescent penetrant that is spray parts with a lime green fluorescent penetrant, and it seeps into the surface of the parts and any subsurface defects. They use a black light for the fluorescent to be little more brilliant and help signify where some of those defects are located Hradecky (2011).\n\nSupply chain issues are expected to persist in an a airline manufacturing and MRO shops raising concerns about rising maintenance costs.\n\n\n\n\nSmartphone\nIn 1990, the United States used to be a global leader in manufacturing, but in 2010, China passed the U.S. going from 3.5% in 1990 to 30.5% in 2021.\nApple and Alphabet hire and send thousands of employees abroad to eversea manufacturing. It was common to send 20,40 engineers at a time to the factory to support prototyping builds to do that learning and finding and fixing of issues and be in the right place at the right time. Apple buying 50 business class seats from San Francisco to Shanghai daily, accounting for $150 million in annual revenue for United Air Lines.\n\nThe popular conception is that companies come to China because of low labor cost. I’m not sure what part of China they go to, but the truth is China stopped being the low labor cost country many years ago and that is not the reason to come to China from a supply point of view. The reason is because of the skill and the quantity of skill in one location and the type of skill it is.\n— Tim Cook - CEO of Apple\n\nAcording to Helwig and Goldman (2024) , manufacturing is subject to learning effect and making high value-added technology products requires specialized process knowledge and when firms or nations stop producing something, developing that capability again is an uphill battle.\nManufacturing process demand a lot of skill and a lot of local supply chain for where all the parts are going to come from to build such a complex product that makes it a very appealing place to build.\nAll products of Apple are designed and engineered in US and they all include components manufactured in U.S. (e.g. iPhone glass is made in Kentucky, and lasers that enable Face ID are built in the U.S. too.). In 2023 Apple annouced $430 billion in new investments across the country, including work with more than nine thousand suppliers across all fifty states in U.S. acording CNBC (2022)\n\nsource: Steve Jobs at MIT 1992\nsource: r’\n\nIn 2012 Google buy Motorola for $12.5 billion and open smartphone manufacturing plant in Fort Worth Texas to build Moto X. The goals was build as American made low cost smartphone but about a year after it opened, the plant shut down, citing high demestic operating costs and low consumer demand. Google sold Motorola to Lenovo for a multibillion dollar loss. Some experts says the U.S. failure shows that the cost of labor and the lack of skill in the U.S. is why manufacturing in the country is not cost effective.\nFoxconn is Apple’s largest supplier and the world’s largest electronic manufacturer. Acording to Yeung (2022) Chairman Terry Gou sayd the core skills and the capabilities of making phones, manufacturing, electronics have moved to Asia and for it to come to America it would be difficult, though not impossible. In 2017, the White House announced Foxconn’s plan to invest $10 billion, and open a massive LCD screen manufacturing facility in Wisconsin creating a 13.000 jobs.\nA smartphone made in America cost $2.000 dollars but the same product made in China cost $1.300, it’s $700 cheaper than the American-made model. The supply chain doesn’t exist. Labor intensive positions is a challange and needs to rebuild.\n\nI worked and managed manufacturing electronics and semiconductors for 30 years. I’ve visited China on manufacturing activities multiple times. I became management and can see the financial statements. In the 1990’s and early 2000’s, labor cost in Asia was the driver. This drove supply chain to go to Asia, even the most complex manufacturing and less labor intensive like chip manufacturing. So in 2000’s it’s supply chain as driver. In the end, it’s profit margin that is driving the companies to manufacture in Asia, particularly China. The US and Europe have given up even their low labor intensive manufacturing capability (chip foundries) and even design capability (engineers are cheaper in Asia). They could still make a profit by manufacturing in the US, but that profit may be only 10% compared to 30% if made in Asia (mostly China). So the root cause is profit MARGIN, not profit.\nFor Beginners and Beyound channel at YouTube\n\n\n\nAutomotive\nTesla Manufacturing by Munro Live and Lars Moravy\nTour of the Giga Factory in Austin Texas by Lars Moravy and Sandy Munro Munro Live (2023) and show how to build the panels for the Tesla Cybertruck.

To improve the scrap utilization the coils are tuned to the parts(optimization system), that’s why we don’t have to weld anything together.\nTransfer presses that the small one make a small parts there we actually insourced about 70% of stampings for model Y and Cybertruck\nPart separation section where the good parts are separated by suction machines while the scrap is sent to the scrap house through gravity and conveyor belt.\nStack parts: Overhead conveyor belts where parts actually come through and drops. It’s very important we don’t the only thing that really can’t screatch HFS is HFS. So we got to be careful when we put it down that we’re not rubbing it againt each other.\nStorage parts: Different blanks all within accuracy tailgate, face hood, doors\nMeasurement system: Basically we have a periodic quality check, take the part put it on a 2d light scanner machine (giant optical comparator) that compare the cut the we’re cutting to in relation to what we’re actually measuring. The results is a level of micron precision that it’s very important for the Elon perspective (japanese uniformity cpk 1.67/2.00). Below is the attention mentioned by the engineer. I also made a graph using the R programing language to illustrate the idea of uniformity Kume (1987)\n\n\n\nWe got to be careful because we’re doing periodic checks to be to make sure this machine has a good CP or CPK or repeatability as what we call it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggQC)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\n#plot a data\nset.seed(1221)\ndata_norm_dist &lt;- \n  data.frame(process_id = 1:1000,\n             sub_group = rep(1:20, each = 5),\n             process_value = rnorm(n = 1000, mean = 10, sd = .5))\n\n#Capability plot\na &lt;- data_norm_dist %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = process_value ))+\n  geom_histogram(bins = 30)+\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(process_value)),\n             linetype = \"dashed\")+\n  stat_QC_Capability(LSL = 8,\n                     USL = 12,\n                     show.cap.summary = c(\"Cp\",\"Cpk\"),\n                     cap.summary.size = 3,\n                     method = \"XmR\")+\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(.15,.6)))+\n  labs(subtitle = \"Maintenace of the present state is all that is needed\",\n       x = \"\")\n\n\n#plot b data\nset.seed(1230)\ndata_dist_lim &lt;- \n  data.frame(process_id = 1:1000,\n             sub_group = rep(1:20, each = 5),\n             process_value = rnorm(1000,10,.5658713))\n\nb &lt;- \n  data_dist_lim %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = process_value))+\n  geom_histogram(bins=30)+\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(process_value)),\n             linetype = \"dashed\")+\n  stat_QC_Capability(LSL = 8,\n                     USL = 12,\n                     show.cap.summary = c(\"Cp\",\"Cpk\"),\n                     cap.summary.size = 3,\n                     method = \"XmR\")+\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = expand_scale(mult = c(.15,1)))+\n  labs(subtitle = \"The spec is satisfied, but there is no extra margin\",\n       x = \"\")\n\n#plot c data\nset.seed(1223)\ndata_dist_out &lt;- \n  data.frame(process_id = 1:1000,\n             sub_group = rep(1:20, each = 5),\n             process_value = rnorm(1000,8.9,.5))\n\nc &lt;- \n  data_dist_out |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = process_value))+\n  geom_histogram(bins = 30)+\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(process_value)),\n             linetype = \"dashed\")+\n  stat_QC_Capability(LSL = 8,\n                     USL = 12,\n                     show.cap.summary = c(\"Cp\",\"Cpk\"),\n                     cap.summary.size = 3,\n                     method = \"XmR\"\n  )+\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = expand_scale(mult = c(.15,.6)))+\n  labs(subtitle = \"It is necessary to take measures to bring the mean closer to the middle\",\n       x = \"\")\n\n#plot d data\nset.seed(1224)\ndata_dist_amp &lt;- \n  data.frame(process_id = 1:1000,\n             sub_group = rep(1:20, each = 5),\n             process_value = rnorm(1000,10,2))\nd &lt;- \n  data_dist_amp %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = process_value))+\n  geom_histogram(bins = 30)+\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(process_value)),\n             linetype = \"dashed\")+\n  stat_QC_Capability(LSL = 8,\n                     USL = 12,\n                     show.cap.summary = c(\"Cp\",\"Cpk\"),\n                     cap.summary.size = 3,\n                     method =\"XmR\")+\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = expand_scale(mult = c(.15,.6)))+\n  labs(subtitle = \"This requires action to reduce the variation\",\n       x = \"\")\n\n#show all plots\n#a + b + c + d + plot_annotation(tag_levels = \"A\", tag_prefix = \"Plot:\")\na + b + c + d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRobotics\nGeneral idea\n\nRobots becoming increasingly prevalent in almost every industry, from healthcare and manufacturing to defense and education.\n\nWelding\nTeaching\nAssemling cars\nPerforming surgery\n\n\n\nRobots Manufacturing\n\nKuka Augsburg, Germany: Industrial robots and factory automation systems.
