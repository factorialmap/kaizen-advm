This includes $39 billion in manufacturing incentives Hawkins (2024)\nIntel has been aawarded $8.5 billion in grants and $11 billion on loan guarantees for new chip fab construction under the CHPS Act acording to Manufacturing@MIT (2024). Pat Gelsinger CEO of the company is in 3 years into a turn-around strategy to get back to advanced chip production leadership, and argued the cutbacks were necessary to generate funding for his strategy of building a foundry business to achieve 5 nodes in 4 years. Bad decisions are made along the way such as make gpu chips for AI, adopting advanced lithography, and expand beyond its very profitable x86-based desktop and server chip business. Similar decisions were nade at GE, and were reversed by Larry Culp. What lessons could he provide?\n\nBattery manufacturing\n\nAcording to Manufacturing@MIT (2024), lithium-ion betteries were invented in United States, but never built the needed supply chains, government support was missing, and batteries faced political and industrial opposition.\nChina that has seized the lead in battery technology, leading battery manufacturing, and making technical progress. The firm A123 was bought for a Chinese company that was transferred its significant technology, then scaled these advances, putting them into domestic hybrid then electric vehicles built with massive government support.\n\nEnergy density in electric battery storage manufacturing\n\nMujeeb Ijaz founder, CEO of Our next energy Michigan made cells LFP technolgy, R&D Center in Fremont California and another one in Boston and Bedford shows us the 3 gerenation analysis about energy storage at MIT Mobility Initiative (2023)\n\n\n\n\nEvolution of energy storage adapted from Mujeeb Ijaz’s presentation\n\n\n\nYet-Ming Chiang is professor of material science and engineering at MIT co-founder of A123 Systems, co-founder of Form Energy, and co-founder of 24M technologies.\nWhat is the limits of energy storage?\nEnergy density\nHe talks about Arpa-e energy gov call for proposals propel 1k that refers to on thousand watt hours per kilogram.

By providing access to cutting-edge hardware, these kits empower people from diverse backgrounds to angage in hands-on experimentation and prototyping Breaking Taps (2024). This, in turn, enables the rapid iteration and refinement of design concepts, accelerating the journey from idea to reality. As a result, dev kits have become an essential tool for driving innovation, fueling breakthroughs, and pushing the boundaries of what is possIble while creating an environment for exapanding supply chain capabilities and knowledge base lgarlati and Gonzalez (2024)\n\nPharmaceutical Industry\n\nSolid dosage products still account for the majority of medicinal products made worldwide, but there are some hurdles to overcome in order to make the tablet of the future. Issues such as patient centricity, solubility, bioavailability conversion of parental products to solid dosage forms are all topics that need to be addressed.\nQuality, variability, new processes, supply chain, and inspection\nSmart pill such as electronic capsule for tageting drug to delivery system.\n\nAviation and Jet Egines manufaturing\n\nJet engine is important part of commerial airplane and reparing them has become a $58 billion business acording to @cnbc2024. A commercial jet engine is a complex, expensive machine made up of thousands of parts and cost of $10 million each one or $6 million for overhaul. The process of overhauling one means disassembling it and replacing all the worn on damaged parts like blades, which can cost up to $20.000 a piece and HPT( high pressure turbine) costing more then $30.000 a piece, and one engine aproximately 40 to 60 of them is necessary. Before the supply chain issues, a typical narrowbody engine took 60 to 75 days to overhaul, and that time has gone up, in some cases to over 200 days because it’s not sufficient spare parts, labor to do this in normal time.\nJet engine manufacturing is dominated by GE Aerospace(12.81%), CFM/Safran(44.77%), Rools-Royce(19.57%) and Pratt & Whitney (22.85%). More than 70% of GE’s commercial engine revenue comes from partes and service, and first two quarters of 2024 GE reported over $15 billion in MRO(maintenance, repair and overhaul) versus $8 billion for new engines.\n\n\n\nCode\n#get stock retursn for GE, RYCEY, SAF.PA, RTX, AIR.PA, BA\n\n\n\nIn U.S. there are over three thousand aircraft repair shops, and the most commonly flown jet engine is CFM56 that 80 to 85% part commonality between engines resulting in a very good reuse capability. The engine has parts which are life time limited and the safe operation of the engine is guaranteed up to 25 to 30 thousand cycles. In the hottest part of a jet engine in 2024, the temperature surrounding the turbine blade is several hundred degrees above the melting point of the material of the turbine blade. Aproximately 1200 parts per engine and many stages for overhauling.\n\nBreak the major flange and then it’ll be separated into the cold and the hot section.\nBroken down into piece and then the parts are cleaned and inspected.\nTesting process envolve techniques such as ultrasound, x-ray, magnetic inspection and fluorescent penetrant that is spray parts with a lime green fluorescent penetrant, and it seeps into the surface of the parts and any subsurface defects. They use a black light for the fluorescent to be little more brilliant and help signify where some of those defects are located Hradecky (2011).\n\nSupply chain issues are expected to persist in an a airline manufacturing and MRO shops raising concerns about rising maintenance costs.\n\n\nSmartphone manufacturing\nIn 1990, the United States used to be a global leader in manufacturing, but in 2010, China passed the U.S. going from 3.5% in 1990 to 30.5% in 2021.\nApple and Alphabet hire and send thousands of employees abroad to eversea manufacturing. It was common to send 20,40 engineers at a time to the factory to support prototyping builds to do that learning and finding and fixing of issues and be in the right place at the right time. Apple buying 50 business class seats from San Francisco to Shanghai daily, accounting for $150 million in annual revenue for United Air Lines.\n\nThe popular conception is that companies come to China because of low labor cost. I’m not sure what part of China they go to, but the truth is China stopped being the low labor cost country many years ago and that is not the reason to come to China from a supply point of view. The reason is because of the skill and the quantity of skill in one location and the type of skill it is.\n- Tim Cook - CEO of Apple\n\nAcording to Helwig and Goldman (2024) , manufacturing is subject to learning effect and making high value-added technology products requires specialized process knowledge and when firms or nations stop producing something, developing that capability again is an uphill battle.\nManufacturing process demand a lot of skill and a lot of local supply chain for where all the parts are going to come from to build such a complex product that makes it a very appealing place to build.\nAll products of Apple are designed and engineered in US and they all include components manufactured in U.S. (e.g. iPhone glass is made in Kentucky, and lasers that enable Face ID are built in the U.S. too.). In 2023 Apple annouced $430 billion in new investments across the country, including work with more than nine thousand suppliers across all fifty states in U.S. acording CNBC (2022)\n\nsource: Steve Jobs at MIT 1992\nsource: r’\n\nIn 2012 Google buy Motorola for $12.5 billion and open smartphone manufacturing plant in Fort Worth Texas to build Moto X. The goals was build as American made low cost smartphone but about a year after it opened, the plant shut down, citing high demestic operating costs and low consumer demand. Google sold Motorola to Lenovo for a multibillion dollar loss. Some experts says the U.S. failure shows that the cost of labor and the lack of skill in the U.S. is why manufacturing in the country is not cost effective.\nFoxconn is Apple’s largest supplier and the world’s largest electronic manufacturer. Acording to Yeung (2022) Chairman Terry Gou sayd the core skills and the capabilities of making phones, manufacturing, electronics have moved to Asia and for it to come to America it would be difficult, though not impossible. In 2017, the White House announced Foxconn’s plan to invest $10 billion, and open a massive LCD screen manufacturing facility in Wisconsin creating a 13.000 jobs.\nA smartphone made in America cost $2.000 dollars but the same product made in China cost $1.300, it’s $700 cheaper than the American-made model. The supply chain doesn’t exist. Labor intensive positions is a challange and needs to rebuild.\n\nI worked and managed manufacturing electronics and semiconductors for 30 years. I’ve visited China on manufacturing activities multiple times. I became management and can see the financial statements. In the 1990’s and early 2000’s, labor cost in Asia was the driver. This drove supply chain to go to Asia, even the most complex manufacturing and less labor intensive like chip manufacturing. So in 2000’s it’s supply chain as driver. In the end, it’s profit margin that is driving the companies to manufacture in Asia, particularly China. The US and Europe have given up even their low labor intensive manufacturing capability (chip foundries) and even design capability (engineers are cheaper in Asia). They could still make a profit by manufacturing in the US, but that profit may be only 10% compared to 30% if made in Asia (mostly China). So the root cause is profit MARGIN, not profit.\nFor Beginners and Beyound channel at YouTube\n\nCar manufacturing\nMunro Live\n\n\n\n\n\nSchuler Technology\n\n\n\n\nMississippi Community College and Golden Triangle Development Link Project\n\n\n\n\nPDCA method using AI and machine learning models\n\n\n\n\n\nEconomic and Personal Finance Education programs by CEE\n\n\n\n\n\nRobotics Career in Manufacturing by RoboticsCareer org\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBreaking Taps. 2024. “Speedrunning 30yrs of Lithography Technology,” July. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuVS7MsQk4Y.\n\n\nCNBC. 2022. “Why the u.s.

    "text": "Predictive Analysis\nManufacturers make the most of data by employing predictive analysis to monitor businesss operations, performance, and potential solutions to problems impeding future prospects. Data are analyzed to identify and avoid recurrent problems or errors in the future.\n\n\nMaintenace\nData analysis plays a crucial role in predict equipment failures, enabling manufacturers to take proactive measures to avoid or mitigate them. By leveraging predictive analytics techniques, manufaturers can identify potential issues before they occur, reducing downtime and increasing overall efficiency.\nTraditional time-based preventative maintenance strategies can be augmented with data-driven insights, allowing for more informed decision-making and optimized maintenance planning. With careful planning and analysis, equipment manufacturers can schedule maintenance breaks or shutdowns to address potential problems, minimizing delays and failures. This proactive approach helps ensure equipment reliability, reduces maintenance costs and optimizes production output.\n\n\nPrice reduction\nData analysis helping manufaturers to optimize their pricing strategies, leading to significant cost reductions. When setting product prices, manufaturers must mconsider a multitude of factors, including raw material costs, manufacturing expenses, distribution fees, maintenance costs, and more. To strike the perfect balance between profitability and customer affordability, manufacturers leverage price optimization techniques.\nBy analyzing pricing and cost data from both internal and external sources, data science anables manufaturers to gain a competitive edge and develop optimized price variants. This data-driven approach allows manufacturers to identify areas of inefficiency, minimize costs, and maximize revenue, ultimately leading to increased profitability and a stronger market presence.\nManufacturers can make informed pricing decisions that drive business growth, improve profitability, ad enhance customer satisfaction.\nExamples:\n\nGain a deeper understanding of their cost structure and identify opportunities for reduction.\nAnalyze market trends and competitor pricing to inform their own pricing strategies.\nAnalyze macro economic trends\nDevelop targeted pricing models that account for variations in customer demand and market conditions.\nOptimize their supply chain and logistics to reduce costs and improve efficiency.\nMonitor and adjust their pricing strategies in real-time to stay ahead of the competition.\n\n\n\nRobotization and Automation\nData analysis is transforming the manufacturing industry by enabling the widespread adoption of automation technologies. Robots are increasingly being used to perform repetitive, mundane, and hazardous tasks, freeing up human workers to focus on higher-value activities. However, the integration and maintenance of robots can be a significant annual expense for manufaturers. This where data science comes in - by analyzing data from various sources(Exploring more in this topic in the future), manufacturers can optimize robot programming and operation, leading to improved product quality and reduced costs.\nThe use of data analysis in automation has made manufacturing robots more accessible and affordable than ever before. As the manufacturing landscape continues t envolve, data analysis will play an incresingly important role in driving the adoption of automation technologies and shaping the future of industry.\nExamples:\n\nAnalyze sensor data from robots to predict and prevent maintenance issues, reducing repair costs and extending equipment lifespan.\nIdentify areas where automation can be improved or expanded, driving further innovation and growth.\nStreamline robot integration and deployment, reducing downtime increasing productivity and availability.\n\n\n\nDirecting the Supply Chain\nData science could help manufaturers to navigate complex risks and uncertainties, and proactively identify potential disruptions, asses their likelihood, and develop strategies to mitigate their impact.\nThe supply chain has always been a compex and dynamic system, but the advent of big data analytics has provided manufacturers with the tools they neet to stay ahead of the curve.\nIn today’s fast-paced environment, predictive analysis and preventive maintenance are assential for managing the supply chain effectively. Effective supply chain management requires a deep understanding of the complex interplay between different variables, including supplier performance, inventory levels, transportation costs, and customer demand.\nData analysis provides manufacturers with the visibility and agility they need to respond quickly to changing market conditions and customer needs.\nExamples:\n\nAnalyze real-time data to identify potential bottlenecks and delays.\nAssess the likehood of major disruptions ond develop contingency plans\nEvaluate the performance of suppliers and identify opportunities for improvement.\nOptimize inventory management and reduce waste.\n\n\n\nInventory Control and Demand Forecasting\n\nEste precisa ser repensado por que ao meu ver sofrerá grandes mudanças.\n\n\n\nWarranty Analysis\nWarranty analysis is a critical aspect of product development, and data science plays an important role in helping manufacturers optimize their warranty claims process.\nBy analizing data from various sources, including product performance, customer feedback, and warranty claims, manufaturers can identify early warning signs for product failures and take proactive measures to address them.\nData scientists can help manufacturers analyze the root causes of product defects, identify patterns and trends, and develop predictive models to forecast potential warranty claims.\nwith the help of AI and warranty analytics, manufacturers can process vast amounts of warranty-related data from multiple sources, including:\n\nProduct sensor data\nCustomer feedback and complaints\nWarranty claims and repair data\nManufacturing and quality control data\n\nBy analyzing this data, manufaturers can gain valuable insights into product performance, identify areas for improvement, and develop targeted solutions to reduce warranty claims and improve customer satisfaction. Data science can help manufaturers:\n\nIndetify patterns and trends in warranty claims data.\nDevelop predictive models for forecast potential warranty claims.\nAnalyzie the root cause of product defects and develop corrective actions.\nOptimize warranty claims processing and reduce costs.\nImprove product quality and reliability\n\nWith data-driven insights, manufacturers can make informed decisions about product development, quality control, and warranty claims management, ultimately driving business growht and success.\n\n\nProduct Authenticity\nProduct authenticity is particularly important in the pharmaceutical and food industries, where counterfeit or adulterated products can have serious consequences for public health.\nNear Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) is a powerfil analytical technique to help manufacturers to ensuring the authenticity of products across various industries. XXXXXXXXXX the unique spectral signatures of materials, NIRS enables the rapid and non-invasive identification fo chemical composition, allowing manufacturers to verify the ahthenticity of their products.\nSome benefits\n\nFast: NIRS can analyze samples in a matter of second, making it an ideal technique for high-volume production environments.\nCost-effective: Is a relative low-cost technique compared to other analytical methods, making it an attractive option for manufacturers.\nNon-invasive: Is a non-destructive technique, which means that samples remain intact and can be used for further analysis or processing.\n\nThe system operates by emitting infrared photons from the light source, which interact with the sample, causing molecular vibrations or stretching within the sample. These interactions result in a spectrum that reflects the properties of the molecules and thei chemical bonds. To extract meaningful information, the spectra undergo specific preprocessing (e.g. PLS,PCA) techniques to eliminate noise and redundat data. Subsequently, these techniques are employed to identify effective wavelengths that precisely classify the product.A well-constructed model can accurately classify the product with minimal error.\nExample:\n\nVerify the identity of raw materials and finished products.\nDetect adulteration or contamination.\nEnsure compliance with regulatory requirements.\nProtect their brand reputation and intellectual property.\nPrevent financial loesses due to counterfeit products.",
