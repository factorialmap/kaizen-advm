Based on @helwig2024, this summary aims to improve my writing skills and understanding of U.S. business analysis and manufacturing process improvement.

The texts may contain typos, imcomplete thoughts, and will be subject to ongoing revision and development. In addition to the primary document used to create this summary, I have also drawn upon the reference documents cited within.

### [**Advanced Manufacturing**]{style="color: #9D0F6A ;"}

-   Advanced manufacturing refers to the use of innovative technology, process and methods like intelligent robotics, additive manufacturing, digital twins, and lean principles to accelerate the design and production of physical goods in the material world. As a result, scale and possibilities that was previously impossible, cost reduction, and value-added products in shorter cycles.

-   This approach depends on the close integration of human capital, machining, networking, sensing, and computational capabilities for example automation, robotics, 3D printing, artificial intelligence, and internet of things(IoT) devices into the manufacturing process.

### [**What is the impact ?**]{style="color: #9D0F6A ;"}

-   **Productivity**: Streamline production processes by automation, reducing cycle times and labor cost.
-   **Costs**: By optimizing processes and reducing waste.
-   **Supply Chain**: IoT and data analytics can improve visibility and efficiency, reducing lead times and inventory costs.
-   **Jobs and skill requirements**: New opportunities in fields like robotics programming, data analysis, and maintenance of advanced machinery.
-   **Quality**: High precision, uniformity and consistency in production.
-   **Customization and Flexibility**: 3D printing enable on-demand manufacturing of highly customizable products without retooling.
-   **Environmental Impact**: By reducing material waste, energy consumption, and gas emissions.

### [**Past, Present and Future**]{style="color: #9D0F6A ;"}

The central idea is to explore past experiences, the present moment, and future possibilities to estimulate our ability of mental time travel. This ability is essential for survival and adaptation, as it helps predict outcomes, learn from mistakes, and build a sense of identity.

**Past** Studying the past helps identify how experiences shape the history and influence memory formation, learning, and can aid in trauma treament. But excessive focus on the past can lead to rumination and depressive states.

         
-   Shorten the distance, improving the flow of traded goods transforming trade, industry, agriculture, and communication in the region and across the country. Erie Canal navigable waterway connecting the great lakes to the atlantic ocean completed in 1825 @dpla1821 . The objective was to develop the city of New York, which was a point of communication with the world (e.g. port of trade hub), and opened up the MidWest for settlement and agricultural expansion, impacting the marginal product of labor @kaiman2024. The canal also had profound societal impacts shaping the nation's economic development in the 19th century:

    -   It spurred westward migration, enhance commercial trade between regions.\
    -   It contibuted to the rise of new towns along its route.\
    -   It facilitated cultural and political unity between the Northest and the expanding western territories.\

-   New processes: Making better products, faster and cheaper. The idea of the the Bessemer process was observed and described by a german adventurer Johan Mandelsio in 1669 during a trip to Japan, was patented by Henry Bessemer in 1855 in U.S., and pupularized by Andrew Carnegie a business visionary in 1870s, which allowed creation of time machines(e.g. bridges, ships, trains, elevators, pipes for oil and water, and vertical buldings). This process cuts the manufacturing time of single steel rail from two weeks to 15 minutes.

-   Knowledge base, science, and data: Improvements in the petroleum refining process using scientific methods, commercial partnerships striving for efficiency in operations, along with product standardization and uniformity. These factors enhanced Rockefeller's natural leadership capabilities.

-   Redefine customer values: Ford, Packard, Apple, Netflix and Tesla are some examples that creates a new damand, delivering an experience previously unknown to consumers.

-   Low levels of stress and anxiety: There is a potential association between consistently low levels of stress and anxiety (particularly when individuals or organizations remain in their confort zones) and a loss of economic competitiveness. While confort zone is beneficial for maintaining mental and physical health, can also lead to complacency. Moderate stressors encourage problem-solving, innovation, and adoption of new technologies. In the long term a lack of challenge and growth opportunities can lead to decreased motivation and creativity. Stress is a know driver of cognitive adaptation which is crucial for maintaining productivity in dynamic economic environments. This type of behavior and its consequences could be observed in the 1980s in the United States @justarandomchannel2019 @petersantenello2024 @frontlinepbs2024b and currently in 2024 in Germany @dwnews2024.


**Present** Focusing on the present helps us undertand how we process information in real time, essential for responding to stimuli quickly and performing daily activities with mindfulness, which reduce stress and enhance well-being. One of the challenges of staying focused on the present is dealing with digital and physical distractions that are present in abundant quantities.

**Challenges** 

-   Disruptive technologies: New ideas and old ones that could be explored by integration with emerging technology such as computational capability, genAI, atomic computer vision.\
-   Demographic shifts around the world: People are getting older and more urban.\
-   Economic activities in emerging markets: Many countries are emerging from poverty, creating opportunities and threats for example new demands, and lower labor costs.\
-   Climate change: New rules to take care of the environment, improving the capacity to adapt and interact with the environment by creating new products and services.\
-   Erosion fo U.S. industrial capacity: Over the past few decades, the U.S. has experienced a significant decline in its industrial capacity. In 1980, the U.S. manufactured over 40 percent of global high-technology goods, facing 18 percent today. This decline poses a threat to both economic competitiveness and national security.\
-   PRC's Dominance: China has emerged as a formidable competitor, cultivation substantial high-tech industrial production capacity and accounting for nearly 30 percent of global manufacturing output. China has strategically prioritized advanced manufacturing as a cornestone of its national rejuvenation strategy.\
-   Skills Gap and Workforce Shortages: Outsourcing production has led to a skills gap in the U.S. workforce. This is compounded by a persistent labor shortage in the manufacturing sector, with a projected shortfall of 2.1 million unfilled jobs by 2030. This shortage hinders the adoption and implementation of advanced manufacturing technologies.\
-   Small and Medium Manufacturing Adoption Barriers: Small and medium-sized manufacturers contribute the majority of the U.S. manufacturing ecosystem and they face significant obstacles in adopting advanced manufacturing technologies. These include a lacka of access to capital, expertise, and resources for system upgrades and integration.\
-   Underinvestment in R&D: The U.S. lag as behind other advanced economies in terms of *manufacturing-related* R&D spending as a percentage of GDP. This underinvestment hampers innovation and the development of cutting-edge manufacturing processes.\
-   Need the key actors working together: Industry, universities and governments\

A modular approach where vehicle sub-assenblies are manufactured independently and connected later. Giga Castings, replacing hundreds of smaller parts with large, single-piece castings simplifies assembly, reduces weight, and improves structural rigidity. Autonomous Production eliminating traditional conveyor belts and exploring autonomous vehicles that move through production areas. Flow chart would go from a linear process flow to a parallel process flow. 30% increase in assembly speed and a 44% increase in worker density requiring a smaller factory, 40% smaller factory footprint leading to lower capital expenditure and 50% reduction in cost of good sold for future vehicles.



### [**Goals**]{style="color: #9D0F6A ;"}

![Illustration of processes guided by objectives and strategy](img/us_mfg_goals.png)

### [**Principles**]{style="color: #9D0F6A ;"}

-   **Learning by doing**: When companies or countries cease production something, it becomes difficult to redevelop that capability. This is due to the speciallized process knowledge required to manufacture high-value-added technology products. Here are some examples of historical process innovations and how they illustrate the importance of learning by doing.

    -   The Watt Process for power generation from steam: James Watt's improvements to the steam engine in the 18th centry weren't solely based on theoretical knowledge. He continuously experimented and refined his designs through practical application, gradually increasing the engine's efficiency and paving the way for the Industrial Revolution.
    -   The Bessemer Process for Steel Production: In the 19th century, Henry Bessemer developed a process for mass-producing steel. This involved blowing air tinto molten iron to remove impurities. While the initial concept was based on scientific principles, the actual implementation required extensive trial and error to perfect. The continuous refinement of the Bessemer process through practical experience led to a significant reduction in steel prices, fueling advancements in construction, transportation, and other industries.
    -   The Planar Process for Microelectronics: Developed in the late 1950s, the plannar process revolutionized the manufacturing of transistors and integrated circuits. This method involved building layers of semiconductor material on a flat substrate. While the scientific understanding of semiconductor was essential, mastering the intricate steps of the planar process required practical experience and continuous improvement through learning by doing. This innovation enabled the miniaturization fo electronics and paved the way for the digital innovation wave.
    
    -   Fordism: Pioneered by Henry Ford in the early 20th century, revolutionized manufacturing through mass production, vertical integration, experimentation and innovation (e.g. introduced the moving assembly line, a radical innovation that significantly accelerated production)
    
Theses cases emphasize that the United States must regain its learning by doing advantage in advanced manufacturing to compete effectively in the global technology landscape.
