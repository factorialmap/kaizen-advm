This summary is based on @helwig2024 and is intended to help me enhance my writing skills and deepen my understanding of the English language, all while engaging in what I enjoy most: Business Analysis and Process Improvement.

The texts may contain typos, unfinished ideas and will be in constant development. In addition to the main document used to build this summary, the referece documents cited in it were also used, which I read and extracted some ideas that I believed to be relevant to my learning.
