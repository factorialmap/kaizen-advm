This summary is based on @helwig2024 and is intended to help me enhance my writing skills and deepen my understanding of the English language, all while engaging in what I enjoy most: Business Analysis and Process Improvement.

The texts may contain typos, imcomplete thoughts, and will be subject to ongoing revision and develppment. In addition to the primary document used to create this summary, I have also drawn upon the reference documents cited within. I have reviewed this secondary sources and extracted relevant concepts that have contributed to my understanding and learning.

### [**What is Advanced Manufacturing ?**]{style="color: #9D0F6A ;"}

-   Advanced manufacturing refers to the use of innovative technology, process and methods(e.g. intelligent robotics, additive manufacturing, digital twins, and lean principles) to accelerate the design and production of physical goods in the material world.

-   This approach depends on the close integration of machining, networking, sensing, and computational capabilities (e.g automation, robotics, 3D printing, artificial intelligence, and internet of things(IoT) devices into the manufacturing process.

### [**What is the goals and impact of advanced manufacturing ?**]{style="color: #9D0F6A ;"}

-   **Increased productivity**: Automation can streamline production processes,reducing cycle times and labor cost.

-   **Cost reduction**: By optimizing processes and reducing waste.

-   **Supply Chain Optimization**: IoT and data analytics can improve visibility and efficiency, reducing lead times and inventory costs.

-   **Job creating and skill requirements**: New opportunities in fields like robotics programming, data analysis, and maintenance of advanced machinery.

-   **Improved Quality**: High precision, uniformity and consistency in production.

-   **Customization and Flexibility**: 3D printing enable on-demand manufacturing of higly customized products without the need for retooling.

-   **Environmental Impact**: By reducing material waste, energy consumption, and gas emissions.

**Past**

-   Shortening distances, improving the flow of traded goods: Erie Canal navigable waterway connecting the great lakes to the atlantic ocean completed in 1825. The objective was to develop the city of New York, which was a point of communication with the world(e.g. port of trade hub), and opened up the MidWest for settlement and agricultural expansion, impacting the marginal product of labor @kaiman2024. The canal also had profound societal impacts shaping the nation's economic development in the 19th century:

    -   It spurred westward migration, enhance commercial trade between regions.

    -   It contibuted to the rise of new towns along its route.

    -   It facilitated cultural and political unity between the Northest and the expanding western territories.

-   Making better products, faster and cheaper: The idea of the the Bessemer process was observed and described by a german adventurer Johan Mandelsio in 1669 during a trip to Japan, was patented by Henry Bessemer in 1855 in U.S., and pupularized by Andrew Carnegie a visionary implementer in 1865, which allowed the expansion of the creation of time machines(e.g. bridges, ships, trains, elevators, pipes for oil and water, and vertical constructions).

-   Data-driven and business improvements: Improvements in the petroleum refining process using scientific methods, commercial partnerships in search of efficiency in operations, along with product standardization and uniformity. These factors enhanced Rockefeller's natural leadership capabilities.

-   Redefine customer values: Ford, Packard, Apple,

-   Low levels of stress and anxiety: There is a potential association between consistently low levels of stress and anxiety (particularly when individuals or organizations remain in their confort zones) and a loss of economic competitiveness. While confort zone is beneficial for maintaining mental and physical health, can also lead to complacency. Moderate stressors encourage problem-solving, innovation, and adoption fo new technologies. Also reduced risk-taking and avoid the risks required to adapt to amrket changes or develop new products. In the short term, it can maintain stable productivity, in the long term a lack of challenge and growth opportunities can lead to decreased motivation and creativity. Stress is a know driver of cognitive adaptation which is crucial for maintaining productivity in dynamic economic environments. This type of behavior and its consequences could be observed in the 1980s in the United States @justarandomchannel2019 @petersantenello2024 @frontlinepbs2024b and currently in 2024 in Germany @dwnews2024.

-   **Present**

-   Disruptive technologies: New ideas or old ones that can now be explored with existing technology(e.g. computational capability, atomic computer vision) and new ways to getting to ideas.

-   Demographic shifts around the world: People are getting older and more urban.

-   Economic activities in emerging markets: Many countries are emerging from poverty, generating new demands and comparative advantages.

-   Climate change: New rules to take care of the environment, improving the capacity to adapt and interact with the environment by creating new products and services.

**Future**

-   Consistence and Competitiveness on Manufacturing

-   Personal Finance

-   Manufacturing base

-   Energy Storage

### [**Goals**]{style="color: #9D0F6A ;"}

![Illustration of processes guided by objectives and strategy](img/us_mfg_goals.png)

### [**What is Advanced Manufacturing**]{style="color: #9D0F6A ;"}

-   Application of digital technologies to the physical world and inovation in the world of atoms for process innovation, or alterations to the manufacturing process that improve how thigs are built. As a result, scale that was previously impossible, cost reduction, and value-added products in shorter cycles.

-   Talk about transition from digitalization to industrial AI and advanced data analytics role, and lean principles.

-   Talk about how to copilot can helps in advance manufaturing

-   Talk about factory of the future and jobs

-   Talk about digital twins

-   Talk about nano tech

-   Talk about South Asia countries

-   Talk about Central e South America

### [**Value Chain**]{style="color: #9D0F6A ;"}

-   Redefined value, changing what customers valued and how it was delivered, then boosted the level of valur that customer expected.

-   Business systems that could deliver more of that value than competitors.

-   Raised customers's expectations beyound the competition's reach. Today's customers have an expanded concept of value that includes convenience of purchase, after-sale service, dependability, and so on.

-   How to deliver superior customer value in line with one of the three value disciplines - operational excellence, customer intimacy or product leadership - in a world where populations are getting older @anjos2024 , more urban, new tehnologies are emerging rapidly, economic activity in emerging markets is expanding rapidly all this without forgetting climate change ?
