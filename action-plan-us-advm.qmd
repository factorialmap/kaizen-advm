title: "Summary of U.S. Advanced Manufacturing Action Plan"
bibliography: references.bib
---

This summary is based on @helwig2024 and is intended to help me enhance my writing skills and deepen my understanding of business analysis and process improvement in the United States of America.

The texts may contain typos, imcomplete thoughts, and will be subject to ongoing revision and development. In addition to the primary document used to create this summary, I have also drawn upon the reference documents cited within.

### [**Advanced Manufacturing**]{style="color: #9D0F6A ;"}

-   Advanced manufacturing refers to the use of innovative technology, process and methods(e.g. intelligent robotics, additive manufacturing, digital twins, and lean principles) to accelerate the design and production of physical goods in the material world. As a result, scale that was previously impossible, cost reduction, and value-added products in shorter cycles

-   This approach depends on the close integration of machining, networking, sensing, and computational capabilities (e.g automation, robotics, 3D printing, artificial intelligence, and internet of things(IoT) devices into the manufacturing process.

### [**What is the impact ?**]{style="color: #9D0F6A ;"}

-   **Increase productivity**: Automation can streamline production processes,reducing cycle times and labor cost.

-   **Cost reduction**: By optimizing processes and reducing waste.

-   **Supply Chain Optimization**: IoT and data analytics can improve visibility and efficiency, reducing lead times and inventory costs.

-   **Jobs and skill requirements**: New opportunities in fields like robotics programming, data analysis, and maintenance of advanced machinery.

-   **Quality improvement**: High precision, uniformity and consistency in production.

-   **Customization and Flexibility**: 3D printing enable on-demand manufacturing of highly customizable products without retooling.

-   **Environmental Impact**: By reducing material waste, energy consumption, and gas emissions.

### [**Past, Present and Future**]{style="color: #9D0F6A ;"}

-   **Past**

    -   Shorten the distance, improving the flow of traded goods transforming trade, industry, agriculture, and communication in the region and across the country. Erie Canal navigable waterway connecting the great lakes to the atlantic ocean completed in 1825 @dpla . The objective was to develop the city of New York, which was a point of communication with the world (e.g. port of trade hub), and opened up the MidWest for settlement and agricultural expansion, impacting the marginal product of labor @kaiman2024. The canal also had profound societal impacts shaping the nation's economic development in the 19th century:

        -   It spurred westward migration, enhance commercial trade between regions.

        -   It contibuted to the rise of new towns along its route.

        -   It facilitated cultural and political unity between the Northest and the expanding western territories.

    -   New processes: Making better products, faster and cheaper. The idea of the the Bessemer process was observed and described by a german adventurer Johan Mandelsio in 1669 during a trip to Japan, was patented by Henry Bessemer in 1855 in U.S., and pupularized by Andrew Carnegie a business visionary in 1870s, which allowed creation of time machines(e.g. bridges, ships, trains, elevators, pipes for oil and water, and vertical buldings). This process cuts the manufacturing time of single steel rail from two weeks to 15 minutes.

    -   Knowledge base, science, and data: Improvements in the petroleum refining process using scientific methods, commercial partnerships striving for efficiency in operations, along with product standardization and uniformity. These factors enhanced Rockefeller's natural leadership capabilities.

    -   Redefine customer values: Ford, Packard, Apple, Netflix and Tesla are some examples that creates a new damand, delivering an experience previously unknown to consumers.

    -   Low levels of stress and anxiety: There is a potential association between consistently low levels of stress and anxiety (particularly when individuals or organizations remain in their confort zones) and a loss of economic competitiveness. While confort zone is beneficial for maintaining mental and physical health, can also lead to complacency. Moderate stressors encourage problem-solving, innovation, and adoption of new technologies. In the long term a lack of challenge and growth opportunities can lead to decreased motivation and creativity. Stress is a know driver of cognitive adaptation which is crucial for maintaining productivity in dynamic economic environments. This type of behavior and its consequences could be observed in the 1980s in the United States @justarandomchannel2019 @petersantenello2024 @frontlinepbs2024b and currently in 2024 in Germany @dwnews2024.

-   **Present**

    -   Disruptive technologies: New ideas and old ones that could be explored by integration with emerging technology such as computational capability, genAI, atomic computer vision.

    -   Demographic shifts around the world: People are getting older and more urban.

    -   Economic activities in emerging markets: Many countries are emerging from poverty, creating opportunities and threats for example new demands, and lower labor costs.

    -   Climate change: New rules to take care of the environment, improving the capacity to adapt and interact with the environment by creating new products and services.

-   **Future**

    -   Consistence and Competitiveness on Manufacturing

    -   Personal Finance

    -   Manufacturing base

### [**Goals**]{style="color: #9D0F6A ;"}

![Illustration of processes guided by objectives and strategy](img/us_mfg_goals.png)

### [**Principles**]{style="color: #9D0F6A ;"}

-   Talk about learning by doing

-   Talk about data standards

-   Talk about R&D

-   Talk about quality, variation, uniformity, deming cycle, shewhart chart etc.

### [**Value Chain**]{style="color: #9D0F6A ;"}

-   Redefined value, create new experiences and perception of benefit For example the value I got from this new electric vehicle.

-   Business systems that could deliver more of that value than competitors.

-   Raised customers's expectations beyound the competition's reach. Today's customers have an expanded concept of value that includes convenience of purchase, after-sale service, dependability, and so on.

-   How to deliver superior customer value in line with one of the three value disciplines - operational excellence, customer intimacy or product leadership - in a world where populations are getting older @anjos2024 , more urban, new tehnologies are emerging rapidly, economic activity in emerging markets is expanding rapidly all this without forgetting climate change ?

![Illustration of value chain](img/new_world_value_chain.png)

**Business Model and Cultural transformation**

-   Acording @treacy1993 to becoming an industry leader requires to choose a value discipline that takes into account its capabilities and culture as well as competitors's strengths .
