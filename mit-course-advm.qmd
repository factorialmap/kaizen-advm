In this space, I share some details about research and studies that I have been working on.

### [**Introduction to Lean Six Sigma Methods**]{style="color: #9D0F6A ;"}

-   Overview about patterns and characteristics such as productivity, quality defects, training hours between North American and Japanese manufacturing in 1990.

-   Lean thinking is dynamic, knowledge-driven, and customer focused process through which all people in a defined enterprise continuously eliminate waste and create value.

-   Lean focused on reduce waste and six sigma focused on reduced waste. Enterprises usually adopt thei own name (e.g Pratt & Whitney - ACE, US air Force - AFS021, Boeig - Lean+ , New York City Health & Hospitals Corp - Breakthrough)

-   Cost price relationship

-   Elements of a process, process map, value in a process, five fundamental lean principles, concepts and tools for implementing lean principles.

    -   Process is a series of actions, changes, or functions which transform inputs to outputs.

    -   Customers also drive the inputs to a process through their needs and requirements.

    -   Process mapping is a graphical representation of an idea or steps using texts, illustrations, ideograms or greometric figures. The idea is to provide a clear vision of the whole thing, the flow of elements in the drawing, and the direction they go @anjos2024

-   Types of value in process steps.

    -   Value added process steps

    -   Necessary waste process steps

    -   Pure waste process steps

## Defining value in a process step - research and evidence-based approach

It requires meticulous and systematic study of cause-and-effect relationship to prevent palliative decisions from resulting in adverse outcomes, which can consume a large amout of resources(e.g. time, money) in the reorganization. An illustration that helps to clarify this idea is the Large Blue Butterfly case in southern England. Recent discoveries have identified a positive correlation between the success of the conservation of Large Blue Butterfly, but also of conservation of Myrmica ants and thyme plants. The ants brig the thyme seeds to the nest along with the butterfly larvae. Because they are physically and chemically similar to myrmica ants in their larval stage and use mimicry, the Phengaris Caterpillars(Large Butterfly larva) deceive the ants using the cuckoo strategy @broodparasitism2024, preying on the ant larvae or begging for food just like a real ant larva. These cause-and-effect relationship were not known in the 1970s, when some countries, in order to solve a problem of overpopulation of rabbits that were destroying crops, took measures by reducing the rabbit population, which, among other things, kept the grass short. From then on, the grass grew quickly cooling the soil, making it an unfavorable environment for the ant, forcing out the ant and depriving the butterfly of the host it depended on, disrupting the process and extinguishing the Large Blue Butterfly that required 40 years of intense scientific research and work to reorganize the system @yong2009. The data also ruled out a popular theory at the time, that butterfly collectors were responsible for the large blue's disappearance. The measures that were taken to keep the collectors away made the situation even worse, as the fances erected to keep them away also kept away grazing animals, further accelerating the growth of grass and the rapid extinction of the large blue.

Professor Earll Murman at @mitopencourseware2014 compares the hours of training in the industry in Japan(380.3) to the United States(46.4). The value of training is difficult to measure in the short term, but studies such as the Ebbinghaus fogetting curve could provide relevant information for understanding the cause-and-effect relationships between consistent training and long-term expertise.

### [**Innovation Systems for Science, Technology, Energy, Manufacturing, and Health**]{style="color: #9D0F6A ;"}

**What is**

-   Innovation: Railroad, telegraph, electricity, quality manufacturing, Internet 2000, Energy systems.

**Important factors**

-   Solow MIT: You got to do R&D to achieve technological innovation

-   Paul Romer Stanford: Human capital engaged in research (talent base) to drive economic growth.

-   Dale Jorgenson Harvard: Core technology + deflationary factor driven the economic growth and innovation.

-   Merryl Linch: Venture capital. Investor understand value of technology breakthroughs, but only support short term development.

-   Federal government supports predominantly research while industr supports predominantly development. Research is going to drive development over an extensive period of time.

**Fases - Innovation pipeline**

Research \> Development \> Prototype \> Demo \> Test \> Production \> Market

**Basic concepts**

-   Data: Fragments that can be analyzed and/or used in the effort to acquire knowledge or make decisions.

-   Science: Observe and understand the natural world

-   Technology: System to organize scientific and technical knowledge or both to achieve a practical purpose.

-   Research: Increasing scientific or technical knowledge or both.

-   Invention: Applying research knowledge to create a practical idea or device.

-   Innovation: Built on scientific discovery and breakthrough invention \* commercialization

-   Innovation system: Ecosystem for developing innovation operates at two levels: institution actors and face-to-face groups.

-   Innovation wave: 40/50 year cycle of innovation based on radical breakthrough, disruptive invention, and then application piled on this, productivity rises, then long period of incremental invention(effect spread around the system)

-   Valley of death: Where innovation and invention usually dies, gap between research and development, institutions often not in place to bridge this gap, and move idea into dev prototyping and production, then invention into innovation @osawa2006.

### [**Advanced Data Analytics For IIOT and Smart Manufacturing**]{style="color: #9D0F6A ;"}

-   This course is on Campus, and is closed. Course length: 4 days

-   This course is structured based on industrial case driving with cases on optical fiber continuous extrusion, preform fabrication, coffe roasting(Nescafe), packaging beverages(tetrapack), engine manufacturing(Nissan), human monitoring and observation factory and clinic for improve quality(BMW), among others.

-   Machine learning base twins on the factory floor process control with real time feedback for quality control.The idea is to expose to IoT(feedback control) data, using statistical trends to identify anormally and automatically improve the process using machine learning models for SPC beyond "normal".

-   Use of laser ultrasound imaging to capture charateristics of object and build digital map for 3D print for example see inside of pipeflows for contaminants. Motion vision make decision base on video in process manufacturing with feedback decision.
