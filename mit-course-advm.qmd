### Introduction to Lean Six Sigma Methods

-   Overview about patterns and characteristics such as productivity, quality defects, training hours between North American and Japanese manufacturing in 1990.

-   Lean thinking is dynamic, knowledge-driven, and customer focused process through which all people in a defined enterprise continuously eliminate waste and create value.

-   Lean focused on reduce waste and six sigma focused on reduced waste. Enterprises usually adopt thei own name (e.g Pratt & Whitney - ACE, US air Force - AFS021, Boeig - Lean+ , New York City Health & Hospitals Corp - Breakthrough)

-   Cost price relationship

-   Elements of a process, process map, value in a process, five fundamental lean principles, concepts and tools for implementing lean principles.

    -   Process is a series of actions, changes, or functions which transform inputs to outputs.

    -   Customers also drive the inputs to a process through their needs and requirements

    -   Process map

    +--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | 1.  Over-production            | Creating more material or information or tests or treatment than needed                   |
    +--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | 2.  Inventory                  | More material or information than needed                                                  |
    +--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | 3.  Transportation             | Moving material or informatio or people                                                   |
    +--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | 4.  Unnecessary movement       | Moving employees to access or process material or information or patients                 |
    +--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | 5.  Waiting                    | Waiting for material, information or treatment or work in process waiting to be processed |
    +--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | 6.  Defective outputs          | Errors or mistakes causing the effort to be redone to correct the problem                 |
    +--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | 7.  Over-processing            | Processing more thena necessary to produce the desired output                             |
    +--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | 8.  Unused employee creativity | Losing improvement opportunities by not engaging or listening to employees                |

-   Genchi genbutsu principles, relying on data and observations produced by others does not give a complete understanding.

    -   Go to the actual place

    -   Talk to the actual people

    -   Doing the actual work

-   Why mapping process is important?

### Innovation Systems for Science, Technology, Energy, Manufacturing, and Health

**What is**

-   Innovation: Railroad, telegraph, electricity, quality manufacturing, Internet 2000, Energy systems.

**Important factors**

-   Solow MIT: You got to do R&D to achieve technological innovation

-   Paul Romer Stanford: Human capital engaged in research (talent base) to drive economic growth.

-   Dale Jorgenson Harvard: Core technology + deflationary factor driven the economic growth and innovation.

-   Merryl Linch: Venture capital. Investor understand value of technology breakthroughs, but only support short term development.

-   Federal government supports predominantly research while industr supports predominantly development. Research is going to drive development over an extensive period of time.

**Fases - Innovation pipeline**

Research \> Development \> Prototype \> Demo \> Test \> Production \> Market

**Basic concepts**

-   Data: Fragments that can be analyzed and/or used in the effort to acquire knowledge or make decisions.

-   Science: Observe and understand the natural world

-   Technology: System to organize scientific and technical knowledge or both to achieve a practical purpose.

-   Research: Increasing scientific or technical knowledge or both.

-   Invention: Applying research knowledge to create a practical idea or device.

-   Innovation: Built on scientific discovery and breakthrough invention \* commercialization

-   Innovation system: Ecosystem for developing innovation operates at two levels: institution actors and face-to-face groups.

-   Innovation wave: 40/50 year cycle of innovation based on radical breakthrough, disruptive invention, and then application piled on this, productivity rises, then long period of incremental invention(effect spread around the system)

-   Valley of death: Where innovation and invention usually dies, gap between research and development, institutions often not in place to bridge this gap, and move idea into dev prototyping and production, then invention into innovation @osawa2006.

### Advanced Data Analytics For IIOT and Smart Manufacturing

-   This course is on Campus, and is closed. Course length: 4 days

-   This course is structured based on industrial case driving with cases on optical fiber continuous extrusion, preform fabrication, coffe roasting(Nescafe), packaging beverages(tetrapack), engine manufacturing(Nissan), human monitoring and observation factory and clinic for improve quality(BMW), among others.

-   Machine learning base twins on the factory floor process control with real time feedback for quality control.The idea is to expose to IoT(feedback control) data, using statistical trends to identify anormally and automatically improve the process using machine learning models for SPC beyond "normal".

-   Use of laser ultrasound imaging to capture charateristics of object and build digital map for 3D print for example see inside of pipeflows for contaminants. Motion vision make decision base on video in process manufacturing with feedback decision.
