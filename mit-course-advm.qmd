### [**Lean Six Sigma**]{style="color: #9D0F6A ;"}

**What Are These Classes About ?**

-   MIT offers 17 classes introducing lean principes and Six Sigma methods, presented by professor Earll Murman, Hugh McManus, Annalisa Weigel, Bo Madsen and more.
-   Recommended book: *Kaizen Express: Fundamentals for Your Lean Journey by Toshiko Narusawa and John Shook*
-   Additional useful video: *Industry Talks E11: James P. Womak - available on YouTube.

**Summary**

-   Overview of productivity, quality defects, and training hours, highlighting differences between North American and Japanese manufacturing in 1990.
-   Lean thinking is a knowledge-driven, customer-focused approach in which everyone within an enterprise continuously work to eliminate waste and create value. Organizations often adopt their own branded version of lean(e.g., GE Aviation-Flight Deck, Pratt&Whitney-ACE, U.S.Air force-AFS021, Boeing-Lean+, NYC Health + Hospitals - Breakthrough)
-   Lean thinking is both a mindset and a set of practices focused on creating more value with fewer resources. It involves continuous experimentation and improvement to eliminate waste and optimize the entire value stream from raw materials to the customer.   

**Types of value in process steps**

-   **Value added process steps**: Transform or shape materials.
-   **Necessary waste process steps**: Regulatory, project coordinations.
-   **Pure waste process steps**: Excess moviment, inventory, wait time, rework, confusion(information process).

**Value Stream map**

Identify all the steps involved in delivering value and eliminate non-value-adding activities.

-   Elements of a process, process map, value in a process, five fundamental lean principles, concepts and tools for implementing lean principles.
-   Process is a series of actions, changes, or functions which transform inputs to outputs.
-   Customers also drive the inputs to a process through their needs and requirements.

**Continuous flow**

-   **Flow**: Ensure a smooth and continuous flow of work through the value stream.
-   **Pull**: Produce only what is needed, when it is needed.
-   **Perfection**: Continuously strive for perfection by eliminating waste and improving processes.

**Social contract or contancy of purpose**

Lean's succes hinges on a strong social contract between employees and the company, supporting a culture of continuous improvement with the aim to become competitive and to stay in business, and to provide jobs. Workers will only contribute ideas if they feel the arrangement is fair and mutually beneficial. Employees are commited to dedicate themselves to their jobs, while the company is commited to provide opportunities for skill development, enabling employees to defend their jobs.

Hosing Kanri focuses on aligning the entire organization around a few critical strategic objectives. It involves setting clear goals, developing action plans, and monitoring progress towards those goals.

Toyota started in 1935 and they only got their system perfected by the mid-1960s. It took them 25+ years of experiments and they've struggled across the world to maintain the standard as they've grown.

Shifting from KPIs to Problem-Solving or instead of giving orders and say do that, do this, they say "Okay, here's the problem, here is the gap that we're trying to close, what are you going to do, how can I help?" That is a different conversation than "make your numbers".

According to @jamesp.womack2022, reducing inventory should not be the primary focus, but rather a result of improving capability and reducing variability. He emphasizes that simply decreasing inventory reduction without addressing underlying issues will lead to stockouts and dissatisfied customers.

**Standard Inventory**

In the Lean world, standard inventory is the necessary amout to protect the customer and maintain a smooth production flow that includes:

-   Safety stock: To buffer againg process incapability
-   Buffer stock: To absorb variations in uptream processes
-   Shipping stock: To accommodate shipping frequency

**Focus on Capabilty and Variability**

-   Improve process capability to consistently produce good results, reducing the need for safety stock.
-   Employ Heijunka (production leveling) to smooth demand and minimize buffer stock.
-   Increase shipping frequency to reduce shipping stock.

**Inventory as a consequence**

When capability improves and variability decreases, the need for standard inventory naturally diminishes, leading to lower inventory levels. In a high-interest-rate environment, reducing inventory becomes even more crucial, as excess inventory ties up capital. In world war 2, Toyota focus on minimizing inventory due to the high cost of money in Japan.

**Continuous improvement**

Evolution of Lean Implementation that has shifted from a consultant-driven. "quick-fix" approach to a coaching model that empowers employees to identify and solve problems themselves. Every day, everyone is involved in eliminating waste, making their jobs easier and taking pride in their work.

**Tools of Lean principles**

**Process mapping** is a graphical representation of an idea or steps using texts, illustrations, ideograms or greometric figures. The idea is to provide a clear vision of the whole thing, the flow of elements in the drawing, and the direction they go @anjos2024

**Basic stability**

Lean focused on reduce waste and six sigma focused on reduced variation creating a basic estability preparing the environment for implementation of Lean.

## Understanding Root Causes: A Scientific, Evidence-Based Approach

Preventing short-sighted or palliative decisions from leading to unintended consequences requires a meticulous and systematic study of cause-and-effect relationships. Whithout this depth of understanding, interventions can consume significant resources(e.g., time, money) during later efforts o reorganize systems.

A compelling illustrations of this principle is the case of the Large Blue Butterfly in southern England. Recent research has revealed a positive correlation between the success conservation of the butterfly and the preservation of Myrmica ants and thyme plants. The ants carry thyme seeds to their nests, along with butterfly larvae. Due to physical and chemical mimicry, the *Phengaris* caterpillars(Large Blue larvae) deceive the ants using a "cuckoo strategy"--a form of brood parasitism-- by preying on ant larvae or begging for food as if they were genuine ant offspring, ensuring the survival and proliferation of the butterfly species. This complex interaction is essential for the betterfly's survival and reproduction.

These intricate ecological relationship were not understood in 1970s, when some countries attempted to control rabbit overpopulation to protect crops. However, rabbits played a crucial role in maintaining short grass. Once their population was reduced, the grass grew rapidly, cooling the soil and creating an unfavorable environment for the thyme plants and Myrmica ants. As the Ants disappeared, so did the butterflies that depended on them. This disruption led to the extinction of the Large Blue Butterfly, and it took 40 years of intensive scientific research to restore the ecosystem.

Interestingly, data later disproved the theory that butterfly collectors caused the species' decline. Ironically, measures to deter them--like fencing--excluded grazing animals, accelerating grass growth and habitat loss.

Professor Earll Murman, in his MIT OpenCourseWare lectures, compares industry training hours in Japan (380.3) to those in the United States(46.4). While the value of training is difficult to measure is the short term, studies like the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve offer insights into the cause-and-effect relationship between consistent training and long-term expertise.

## What are digital twins

Digital twin is a virtual model of a physical object, product, process, or system that is regularly updated with data to maintain a strong resemblance to its real-world counterpart. 

Think of it like a very detailed, always-on simulation(e.g., if you have a physical machine on a factory floor, its digital twn would be a software mdoel taht gets constant updates from sensors on the real machine. This allows you to monitor, analyze, and event predict the behavior of the physical assent without directly interacting with it)
