### [**Lean Six Sigma**]{style="color: #9D0F6A ;"}

**What is it?**

-   There are 17 classes with an introduction to lean principles and six sigma methods, published by MIT and presented by professors Earll Murman, Hugh McManus, Annalisa Weigel and Bo Madsen.

-   Book that may be useful: Kaizen Express: Fundamentals for Your Lean Journey

**Summary**

-   Overview about patterns and characteristics such as productivity, quality defects, training hours between North American and Japanese manufacturing in 1990.

-   Lean thinking is dynamic, knowledge-driven, and customer focused process through which all people in a defined enterprise continuously eliminate waste and create value.

-   Lean focused on reduce waste and six sigma focused on reduced waste. Enterprises usually adopt thei own name (e.g Pratt & Whitney - ACE, US air Force - AFS021, Boeig - Lean+ , New York City Health & Hospitals Corp - Breakthrough)

-   Cost price relationship

![Illustration of Cost price relationship - adapted from MIT lectures](img/cost_value_relationship.png)

-   Elements of a process, process map, value in a process, five fundamental lean principles, concepts and tools for implementing lean principles.

    -   Process is a series of actions, changes, or functions which transform inputs to outputs.

    -   Customers also drive the inputs to a process through their needs and requirements.

    -   Process mapping is a graphical representation of an idea or steps using texts, illustrations, ideograms or greometric figures. The idea is to provide a clear vision of the whole thing, the flow of elements in the drawing, and the direction they go @anjos2024

-   Types of value in process steps.

    -   Value added process steps

    -   Necessary waste process steps

    -   Pure waste process steps

## Defining value in a process step - research and evidence-based approach

It requires meticulous and systematic study of cause-and-effect relationship to prevent palliative decisions from resulting in adverse outcomes, which can consume a large amout of resources(e.g. time, money) in the reorganization. An illustration that helps to clarify this idea is the Large Blue Butterfly case in southern England. Recent discoveries have identified a positive correlation between the success of the conservation of Large Blue Butterfly, but also of conservation of Myrmica ants and thyme plants. The ants brig the thyme seeds to the nest along with the butterfly larvae. Because they are physically and chemically similar to myrmica ants in their larval stage and use mimicry, the Phengaris Caterpillars(Large Butterfly larva) deceive the ants using the cuckoo strategy @broodparasitism2024, preying on the ant larvae or begging for food just like a real ant larva. These cause-and-effect relationship were not known in the 1970s, when some countries, in order to solve a problem of overpopulation of rabbits that were destroying crops, took measures by reducing the rabbit population, which, among other things, kept the grass short. From then on, the grass grew quickly cooling the soil, making it an unfavorable environment for the ant, forcing out the ant and depriving the butterfly of the host it depended on, disrupting the process and extinguishing the Large Blue Butterfly that required 40 years of intense scientific research and work to reorganize the system @yong2009. The data also ruled out a popular theory at the time, that butterfly collectors were responsible for the large blue's disappearance. The measures that were taken to keep the collectors away made the situation even worse, as the fances erected to keep them away also kept away grazing animals, further accelerating the growth of grass and the rapid extinction of the large blue.

Professor Earll Murman at @mitopencourseware2014 compares the hours of training in the industry in Japan(380.3) to the United States(46.4). The value of training is difficult to measure in the short term, but studies such as the Ebbinghaus fogetting curve could provide relevant information for understanding the cause-and-effect relationships between consistent training and long-term expertise.
