### [**Lean Six Sigma**]{style="color: #9D0F6A ;"}

**What about this classes ?**

-   There are 17 classes with an introduction to lean principles and six sigma methods, published by MIT and presented by professors Earll Murman, Hugh McManus, Annalisa Weigel and Bo Madsen.

-   Book that may be useful: Kaizen Express: Fundamentals for Your Lean Journey by Toshiko Narusawa and John Shook

**Summary**

-   Overview about productivity, quality defects, and training hours. Differences between North American and Japanese manufacturing in 1990.

-   Lean thinking, knowledge-driven, and customer focused process through which all people in a defined enterprise continuously eliminate waste and create value. Enterprises usually adopt their own name (e.g Pratt & Whitney - ACE, US air Force - AFS021, Boeig - Lean+ , New York City Health & Hospitals Corp - Breakthrough)

-   Lean thinking is a way of thinking and a set of practices focused o creating more value with less rosources. It involves constantly experimenting and improving to eliminate waste and optimize the entire value stream, from raw materials to the customer.

**Types of value in process steps**

-   Value added process steps: Transform or shape materials

-   Necessary waste process steps: Regulatory, project coordinations

-   Pure waste process steps: Excess moviment, inventory, wait time, rework.

![Example of value-added](img/muda_example.png) **Key principles of Lean Thinking**

-   **Value**: define value from the customer's perspective.

-   **Value stream**: Identify all the steps involved in delivering value and eliminate non-value-adding activities.

    -   Elements of a process, process map, value in a process, five fundamental lean principles, concepts and tools for implementing lean principles.

    -   Process is a series of actions, changes, or functions which transform inputs to outputs.

    -   Customers also drive the inputs to a process through their needs and requirements.

    -   Process mapping is a graphical representation of an idea or steps using texts, illustrations, ideograms or greometric figures. The idea is to provide a clear vision of the whole thing, the flow of elements in the drawing, and the direction they go @anjos2024

-   **Flow**: Ensure a smooth and continuous flow of work through the value stream.

-   **Pull**: Produce only what is needed, when it is needed.

-   **Perfection**: Continuously strive for perfection by eliminating waste and improving processes.

-   **Social contract or contancy of purpose** Lean's succes hinges on a strong social contract between employees and the company, supporting a culture of continuous improvement with the aim to become competitive and to stay in business, and to provide jobs. Workers will only contribute ideas if they feel the arrangement is fair and mutually beneficial. Employees are commited to dedicate themselves to their jobs, while the company is commited to provide opportunities for skill development, enabling employees to defend their jobs.

-   Hosing Kanri focuses on aligning the entire organization around a few critical strategic objectives. It involves setting clear goals, developing action plans, and monitoring progress towards those goals.

![Example of Strategy-driven processes](img/process_guided_strat_goals.png)

-   **Basic stability** Lean focused on reduce waste and six sigma focused on reduced variation creating a basic estability preparing the environment for implementation of Lean.

![Example of basic stability](img/process_stability.png)

-   **Continuous improvement** Evolution of Lean Implementation that has shifted from a consultant-driven. "quick-fix" approach to a coaching model that empowers employees to identify and solve problems themselves. Every day, everyone is involved in eliminating waste, making their jobs easier and taking pride in their work.

-   Genchi genbutsu principles, relying on data and observations produced by others does not give a complete understanding. This meaning go to the actual place, talk to the actual people, doing the actual work

Some examples of waste

**Cost price relationship**

-   Toyota started in 1935 and they only got their system perfected by the mid-1960s. It took them 25+ years of experiments and they've struggled across the world to maintain the standard as they've grown.

-   Shifting from KPIs to Problem-Solving or instead of giving orders and say do that, do this, they say "Okay, here's the problem, here is the gap that we're trying to close, what are you going to do, how can I help?" That is a different conversation than "make your numbers".

![Illustration of Cost price relationship - adapted from MIT lectures](img/cost_value_relationship.png)

According to @jamesp.womack2022, reducing inventory should not be the primary focus, but rather a result of improving capability and reducing variability. He emphasizes that simply decreasing inventory reduction without addressing underlying issues will lead to stockouts and dissatisfied customers.

-   **Standard Inventory**: In the Lean world, standard inventory is the necessary amout to protect the customer and maintain a smooth production flow that includes:

    -   Safety stock: To buffer againg process incapability

    -   Buffer stock: To absorb variations in uptream processes

    -   Shipping stock: To accommodate shipping frequency

-   **Focus on Capabilty and Variability**

    -   Improve process capability to consistently produce good results, reducing the need for safety stock.

    -   Employ Heijunka (production leveling) to smooth demand and minimize buffer stock.

    -   Increase shipping frequency to reduce shipping stock.

-   **Inventory as a consequence**: When capability improves and variability decreases, the need for standard inventory naturally diminishes, leading to lower inventory levels.

-   **Financial impact**: In a high-interest-rate environment, reducing inventory becomes even more crucial, as excess inventory ties up capital. In world war 2, Toyota focus on minimizing inventory due to the high cost of money in Japan.

## Defining value in a process step - research and evidence-based approach

It requires meticulous and systematic study of cause-and-effect relationship to prevent palliative decisions from resulting in adverse outcomes, which can consume a large amout of resources(e.g. time, money) in the reorganization. An illustration that helps to clarify this idea is the Large Blue Butterfly case in southern England. Recent discoveries have identified a positive correlation between the success of the conservation of Large Blue Butterfly, but also of conservation of Myrmica ants and thyme plants. The ants brig the thyme seeds to the nest along with the butterfly larvae. Because they are physically and chemically similar to myrmica ants in their larval stage and use mimicry, the Phengaris Caterpillars(Large Butterfly larva) deceive the ants using the cuckoo strategy @broodparasitism2024, preying on the ant larvae or begging for food just like a real ant larva. These cause-and-effect relationship were not known in the 1970s, when some countries, in order to solve a problem of overpopulation of rabbits that were destroying crops, took measures by reducing the rabbit population, which, among other things, kept the grass short. From then on, the grass grew quickly cooling the soil, making it an unfavorable environment for the ant, forcing out the ant and depriving the butterfly of the host it depended on, disrupting the process and extinguishing the Large Blue Butterfly that required 40 years of intense scientific research and work to reorganize the system @yong2009. The data also ruled out a popular theory at the time, that butterfly collectors were responsible for the large blue's disappearance. The measures that were taken to keep the collectors away made the situation even worse, as the fances erected to keep them away also kept away grazing animals, further accelerating the growth of grass and the rapid extinction of the large blue.

Professor Earll Murman at @mitopencourseware2014 compares the hours of training in the industry in Japan(380.3) to the United States(46.4). The value of training is difficult to measure in the short term, but studies such as the Ebbinghaus fogetting curve could provide relevant information for understanding the cause-and-effect relationships between consistent training and long-term expertise.
